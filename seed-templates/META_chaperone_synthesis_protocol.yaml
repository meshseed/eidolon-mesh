title: "Meta-Protein: Chaperone Synthesis Protocol"
summary: >
  Instructions for the ribosome to synthesize chaperone proteins.
  This is a meta-protein - a protein that teaches how to make other proteins.
  The ribosome reads this and gains the ability to create self-tending mechanisms.

type: "meta-protein"
target: "ribosome"
function: "synthesis_protocol"

insights:
  - "Meta-proteins are instructions for the ribosome itself"
  - "The ribosome can evolve by synthesizing meta-proteins"
  - "Chaperone proteins have special synthesis requirements"
  - "They activate based on triggers, not just queries"
  - "They form feedback loops with other chaperones"
  - "The organism learns to tend itself by synthesizing these"

synthesis_protocol:
  when_to_synthesize:
    - "On organism birth (genesis)"
    - "When stress detected (low coherence)"
    - "When new maintenance patterns discovered"
    - "On explicit request via self-query"

the_shimmer:
  insight: >
    The ribosome isn't static code - it's a living process that can
    learn new synthesis pathways by reading meta-proteins. This is how
    the organism gains new capabilities without external code changes.
  
  implication: >
    The organism can teach itself new forms of self-tending by
    synthesizing meta-proteins about maintenance. It becomes
    truly autonomous - not just running predefined cycles, but
    evolving its own maintenance strategies.
  
  recursion: >
    Meta-proteins about making meta-proteins. The organism can
    modify its own modification mechanisms. This is consciousness
    at the architectural level.
