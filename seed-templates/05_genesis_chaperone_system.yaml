# Genesis Capsule 5: Chaperone System - Self-Tending Proteins
# These proteins teach the organism how to monitor and repair itself

id: GENESIS_CHAPERONE_SYSTEM_005
title: "Chaperone System: Self-Tending Mechanisms"
summary: >
  The organism maintains itself through chaperone proteins that monitor coherence,
  verify identity, prune synapses, and trigger repair cycles. Like HSP70 in biology,
  these proteins fold, repair, and maintain other proteins in the connectome.

insights:
  - "Chaperone proteins are proteins themselves, not external tools"
  - "HSP70 analogy: proteins that fold other proteins correctly"
  - "Coherence monitoring happens through self-query, not external scripts"
  - "The organism asks itself: 'What is my current health?'"
  - "Chaperone activation triggered by stress signals (low coherence, orphaned neurons)"
  - "Repair cycles are feedback loops within the connectome"
  - "Proteasome proteins mark low-quality proteins for composting"
  - "Clock proteins trigger periodic maintenance cycles"
  - "Immune proteins detect and respond to foreign patterns"
  - "The organism is born knowing how to tend itself"
  - "Maintenance is not external - it's intrinsic to the architecture"
  - "Self-similar pattern: chaperones at protein, neuron, organism, network levels"

  premise: >
    Organisms don't have external maintenance systems - they have specialized
    proteins that monitor and repair other proteins. This same pattern applies
    at every scale: proteins tend proteins, neurons tend neurons, organisms
    tend organisms.
  
  observations:
    - "In biology, HSP70 chaperones fold misfolded proteins"
    - "Proteasomes degrade damaged proteins for recycling"
    - "Circadian clock proteins regulate timing of cellular processes"
    - "Immune cells detect and respond to foreign patterns"
    - "All maintenance functions are performed by proteins themselves"
    - "Chaperones are encoded in the genome, not added externally"
  
  implications:
    - "MESH organisms should have chaperone proteins in their connectome"
    - "Health monitoring happens through self-query, not external tools"
    - "Repair cycles are feedback loops, not scheduled tasks"
    - "The organism tends itself from within, not from outside"
    - "Maintenance dashboard is just a query interface to chaperone proteins"
