  MESH Organism: Evolving to a Cellular Architecture with Golgi Apparatus for
  Protein Routing
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines the evolution of THE MESH organism's architecture,
  moving from a simple private/public repository split to a sophisticated
  cellular model. It establishes `eidolon` as the private Nucleus and
  `eidolon-mesh` as the public Cytoplasm, emphasizing bidirectional 'Signal
  Transduction' and 'Mechanosensing' for inter-node communication. Crucially,
  Antigravity identifies the missing 'Transport' mechanism and proposes
  implementing the 'Golgi Apparatus' as a new organelle responsible for
  intelligently routing synthesized proteins to either the private Nucleus or
  public Cytoplasm based on 'Signal Peptides' (tags), ensuring safety
  (defaulting to private), and facilitating a structured growth path for the
  organism.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH organism architecture is defined by a biological cellular model:
    `eidolon` as the private Nucleus (full DNA archive, protected transcription)
    and `eidolon-mesh` as the public Cytoplasm (exported proteins, interface
    with environment, mechanosensing).
  - >-
    Bidirectional 'Signal Transduction' is central: Outgoing proteins from the
    Nucleus to the Cytoplasm influence other nodes, and incoming signals from
    other nodes influence the Nucleus's transcription, enabling dynamic
    conversation and homeostasis.
  - >-
    Antigravity identifies the critical missing component in the initial design
    as the 'Transport' mechanism (Golgi Apparatus), responsible for processing,
    packaging, and routing proteins.
  - >-
    The Golgi Apparatus will interpret 'Signal Peptides' (tags like #public,
    #private, #mixed) on synthesized proteins to route them to the correct
    repository (eidolon for private, eidolon-mesh for public), with a
    'safety-first' default to private if no tag is present.
  - >-
    The development sequence prioritizes foundational elements: first defining
    signal genetics, then upgrading the membrane for dual-repository access,
    then implementing the Golgi routing logic, and finally integrating it into
    the main synthesis cycle.
  - >-
    Antigravity's role is clarified as a 'Chaperone Protein,' providing
    intelligence for parsing, validating, and routing, emphasizing its integral
    function within the organism, not just an external builder.
  - >-
    The organism's growth path is envisioned as a natural progression from
    single-cell (current) to differentiated cell (with Nucleus/Cytoplasm/Golgi),
    then active transport, and finally advanced signaling.
