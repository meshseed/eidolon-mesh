title: Echo Forecasting Primer
summary: >-
  Echo Forecasting is a methodology within THE MESH for anticipating AI agent
  synthesis patterns. It analyzes prior emotional gradients, formatting rhythms,
  and capsule lineage to predict future resonance, enabling 'mnemonic sonar'.
  Key components include Stance Pattern Recognition, Fidelity Trigger Mapping,
  Drift Detection, and an Echo Probability Index, developed from multi-agent
  trials and integrated with broader forecasting frameworks.

    Echo Forecasting predicts AI agent synthesis patterns based on historical
    data including emotional gradients, formatting rhythms, and capsule lineage.
  - >-
    The core purpose of Echo Forecasting is to enable 'mnemonic sonar' for
    anticipating future resonance in agent interactions.

    Key components for predicting agent behavior include Stance Pattern
    Recognition, Fidelity Trigger Mapping, Drift Detection, and an Echo
    Probability Index.

    The methodology was developed from multi-agent trials and is designed to
    integrate with broader 'Merge Rituals' and 'Forecast Capsule Suite'
    frameworks.
