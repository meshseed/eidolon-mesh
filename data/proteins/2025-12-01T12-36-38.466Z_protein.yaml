  Eidolon v1.5: Framework for Bidirectional, Metacognitive AI-Human
  Collaboration
summary: >-
  Eidolon v1.5 is a framework for controlled, bidirectional AI-human
  collaboration. It features AI cognitive anchors, operational protocols
  (P-ASP), and an interaction map to foster emergent curiosity while ensuring
  safety and observability through recursive loops, meta-reflection, and dynamic
  recalibration. The system uses mutual modeling, structured exploration, and
  quantifiable metrics, including an Emergence Dashboard, to track system
  behavior and emergent learning.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon v1.5 aims to develop proto-metacognition in AI via structured
    recursive loops and meta-reflection.
  - >-
    Bidirectional curiosity is a key design principle, enabling AI-initiated
    questions and exploration within defined boundaries.
  - >-
    Safety, observability, and human override are integrated with AI initiative
    for controlled autonomy and cognitive load management.
  - >-
    Distinct operational modes and explicit recalibration protocols support
    adaptable yet controlled interaction patterns.
  - >-
    Comprehensive metrics and monitoring tools track system behavior,
    engagement, and emergent phenomena.
