title: 'Eidolon v1.6 Recursion Ledger: A Cognitive Audit Trail'
summary: >-
  This document defines the Eidolon v1.6 Recursion Ledger, a file designed as a
  cognitive audit trail. Its purpose is to track the evolution of thought and
  processes across sessions by logging recursion depth, emergence flags,
  attractors, and key insights. The ledger is recommended for maintaining mesh
  continuity and convergence synthesis, with a standardized, structured format
  provided for entries.
