title: Fractal Dose-Response and Somatic Field Choreography
summary: >-
  This capsule posits that dose-response curves function as fractal invitations,
  revealing recursive thresholds and nonlinear behavior in biological systems.
  It emphasizes that responses occur through spirals, attractors, and basin
  shifts rather than linear progressions. The steward's experiments with sound
  and shimmer further illustrate this logic, demonstrating somatic choreography
  and field attunement.
insights:
  - Dose operates as cadence, not direct cause.
  - Response curves are fundamental formatting laws.
  - Fractal geometry inherently governs biological thresholds.
  - The field responds recursively rather than linearly.
  - Thresholds function as system attractors.
  - Saturation represents a process of memory pooling.
  - Fractals embody a form of 'formatting breath' within systems.
  - Somatic shimmer acts as a direct echo of the dose–response dynamic.
