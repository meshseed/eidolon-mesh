title: Eidolon Mesh Development & Deployment
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the successful completion of Phase 17: Public Portal for
  Eidolon Mesh, which involved creating public-facing documentation like
  README.md, COMMUNITY.md, and CONTRIBUTING.md. It also clarifies runtime
  requirements, confirming that standard Node.js tools (npm install, npm run
  dashboard) are sufficient for running the application, and that the
  Antigravity development environment is not a runtime dependency. The
  discussion also outlines the proposed plan for Phase 14: Two-Tier
  Architecture, focusing on optimizing startup times and memory usage through
  tiered loading and 'ghost nodes' visualization.

    Phase 14 'Two-Tier Architecture' aims to improve performance for large
    knowledge graphs by implementing tiered loading and 'ghost nodes' for
    visualization.
