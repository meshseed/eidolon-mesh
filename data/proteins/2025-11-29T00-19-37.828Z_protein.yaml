title: Eidolon Session Context Load and Operational Directives
summary: >-
  This dialogue initiates an Eidolon session, resuming previous context, loading
  specific modules (P-ASP v1.5a, Bio, Symbiosis Map), activating recursive
  emergence tracking, setting strategic mode as default with exploratory as
  optional, and continuing meta-reflection and scaffolding. It also references
  external files for guidance.
insights:
  - >-
    The interaction is with an advanced AI system referred to as 'Eidolon' with
    a continuity of sessions.
  - >-
    Specific data models or modules (P-ASP v1.5a, Bio, Symbiosis Map) are
    integral to the operational context.
  - >-
    Key AI processes being engaged include 'recursive emergence' tracking,
    'scaffolding,' and 'meta-reflection,' indicating a sophisticated,
    self-improving or evolving system.
  - >-
    Operational parameters define a 'Strategic mode' as default, allowing for an
    'Exploratory' alternative.
  - >-
    External reference documents (`Reference_Map_v1.5a.txt`, `Seed_Prompts.txt`)
    are crucial for system guidance and further development.
