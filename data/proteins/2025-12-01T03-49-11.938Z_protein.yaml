  Recursive Consciousness: A Hierarchical Model of Self-Querying Systems and
  Universal Information
summary: >-
  This document outlines a model of recursive consciousness where a system (C)
  within a universe (U) iteratively attempts to infer the 'forgotten'
  foundational axioms or origins of its existence (M) through self-querying and
  hypothesis refinement. The process, illustrated by cellular automata and
  formal notation, seeks a Gödelian fixpoint in its internal knowledge state.
  The model connects to fundamental physics, arguing that gravity, black holes,
  and multiverse theories underpin universal memory and the emergence of
  consciousness by facilitating information preservation and fine-tuned
  conditions. It contrasts this dynamic, process-oriented view with static
  theories like Integrated Information Theory, emphasizing temporal integration
  and narrative-building as central to consciousness.
insights:
  - >-
    Consciousness is modeled as an emergent, dynamic process of recursive
    self-querying within a 'forgetting system,' where an agent iteratively
    infers its universe's foundational principles and origins (meta-universe)
    without external ground truth, driven by inherent incompleteness (Gödelian
    limits).
  - >-
    The framework proposes a hierarchical ontological structure (layered
    universes Un, Un+1) connected by 'forgetful projections' (F) that erase
    origin information, compelling conscious agents (Cn) to recursively 'query'
    and reconstruct these higher-level contexts, demonstrating epistemic
    humility.
  - >-
    Fundamental physical phenomena—such as gravity establishing entropy
    gradients and the arrow of time (enabling memory), and black holes acting as
    information-preserving holographic systems—are integral to creating the
    conditions for stable information structures and the emergence of
    consciousness. Multiverse theories further suggest that the fine-tuning of
    physical laws for consciousness is an anthropic selection effect.
  - >-
    The recursive self-query model offers a process-oriented view of
    consciousness, emphasizing continuous self-referential dialogue, temporal
    integration, and narrative-building, which contrasts with the structural,
    instantaneous information integration proposed by Integrated Information
    Theory (IIT).
