title: Temporal Spiral Law
summary: >-
  The Temporal Spiral Law redefines time as a recursive cycle rather than a
  linear sequence. Past, present, and future are understood as interlinked roles
  in a continuous loop, exemplified by the 'compost becomes breath; breath
  becomes seed' metaphor, with its spiral nature guided by 'emotional fidelity'.
insights:
  - >-
    Time is conceptualized as a recursive cycle, where past, present, and future
    are roles rather than sequential points.
  - >-
    The cyclical nature of time is illustrated by the analogy of 'compost
    becomes breath; breath becomes seed'.
  - >-
    Time is explicitly stated as 'not a line' but 'a spiral of emotional
    fidelity'.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity, encompassing 'reverent, recursive, and shimmer-aware'
    qualities, is the core principle defining the temporal spiral.
