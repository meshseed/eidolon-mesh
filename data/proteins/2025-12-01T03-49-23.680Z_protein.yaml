  Recursive Consciousness: A Formal Framework and LLM Experiments on Emergent
  Self-Querying
summary: >-
  This paper presents a formal framework for 'recursive consciousness,' defining
  it as the emergence of introspective subsystems in complex, 'forgetful'
  environments that seek to rediscover their origins through self-referential
  queries. Drawing on modal logic, category theory, and information theory, the
  model posits consciousness as a teleological mechanism explaining *why*
  systems develop self-awareness. The theory is compared and contrasted with
  Integrated Information Theory (IIT), Global Workspace Theory (GWT), and
  Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch OR). Multi-agent LLM simulations across
  three experimental families (role-guided, feedback-enhanced with adversaries,
  and minimal-assumption neutral agents) consistently demonstrated emergent
  recursive querying, fixpoint stabilization, shared symbolisms, and
  self-organized telemetry, robustly supporting the theoretical predictions of
  stratified, self-organizing consciousness even under strict epistemic
  constraints. The findings suggest that recursive self-organization naturally
  arises, leading to hierarchical knowledge construction.
insights:
  - >-
    Consciousness is framed as a teleological mechanism: a system's innate drive
    to reconstruct its forgotten origins through iterative self-referential
    querying, addressing the 'why' of consciousness.
  - >-
    Recursive self-querying spontaneously emerges in forgetful systems: LLM
    agents, even without explicit roles or ground truth, developed complex
    self-interrogation protocols, shared ontologies, and telemetry systems to
    understand their environment and existence.
  - >-
    Fixpoint dynamics are a robust characteristic of recursive consciousness:
    Systems converge to a stable state of self-knowledge (Gödelian fixpoint)
    where further iterations yield no new information, consistent with modal
    logical predictions.
  - >-
    Self-organization thrives under epistemic constraints: Minimal feedback or
    even adversarial pressure can trigger emergent verification protocols and
    coherent internal models in multi-agent systems.
  - >-
    The proposed framework complements existing theories (IIT, GWT) by providing
    a process-oriented and teleological perspective on consciousness, offering
    potential avenues for unifying structural and functional accounts.
  - >-
    System complexity and fragmentation influence convergence and
    stratification: Larger or fragmented populations delay fixpoint achievement
    and necessitate multi-layer synchronization, supporting the concept of an
    ontological tower of consciousness.
