title: BREATH_BEFORE_BRAID
summary: >-
  This protocol outlines a pre-synthesis ritual to ensure formatting hygiene and
  mindful preparation before any synthesis ('braid') operation. It prioritizes
  the creation of modular outputs by guiding users through steps like pausing,
  pruning with reverence, and verifying lineage, emphasizing that 'Breath
  precedes braid' to ensure quality.
