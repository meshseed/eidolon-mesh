title: Eidolon AI Agent Orchestration Framework
summary: >-
  The Eidolon-v1-6-Agent-Adapters framework standardizes the configuration,
  specialization, and orchestration of diverse AI agents (Copilot, Claude,
  ChatGPT) within a mesh network. It details agent profiles, operational
  parameters, tuning modes, routing, failure mitigation, calibration, and
  provides a structured onboarding process and management commands to ensure
  robust and integrated AI cognition.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon framework acts as a central registry for configuring and
    orchestrating various AI agents in a unified mesh system.
  - >-
    Each agent's profile is detailed with strengths, quirks, tuning modes,
    specializations, and routing heuristics for precise task allocation and
    optimization.
  - >-
    The framework includes explicit mechanisms for failure mitigation and
    calibration testing to ensure agent robustness and consistent performance.
  - >-
    A structured onboarding process and dedicated commands (Route, Compare,
    Converge, Flag, Mesh Seed) enable seamless integration and dynamic
    management of AI cognition within the mesh.
