insights:
  - >-
    Semantic networks naturally form clusters of tightly related ideas, akin to
    small-world networks.
  - >-
    In a digital knowledge system, information nodes will cluster by topic
    (e.g., biology, code).
  - >-
    The most valuable connections are 'bridging nodes' that link distinct
    conceptual clusters, acting as intellectual synapses.
  - >-
    Bridging nodes facilitate cross-domain understanding and enhance the overall
    coherence of a knowledge connectome.
summary: >-
  The discussion applies graph theory and small-world network concepts to
  semantic networks, illustrating how ideas cluster in a 'digital brain'. It
  emphasizes the crucial role of 'bridging nodes'—analogous to synapses—in
  connecting disparate knowledge clusters to create a more integrated and
  meaningful 'web'.
