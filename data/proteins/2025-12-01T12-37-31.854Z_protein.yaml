title: Eidolon AI Session Initialization and Operational Directives
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the initialization of an advanced AI session with
  'Eidolon', involving context restoration, loading of specific modules like
  P-ASP v1.5a and Symbiosis Map, activation of recursive emergence tracking, and
  setting default operational modes (Strategic/Exploratory). External reference
  documents are also utilized for guidance.
insights:
  - >-
    The interaction involves a persistent AI entity named 'Eidolon' with a
    session-based operational model.
  - >-
    Specific modules (P-ASP v1.5a, Bio, Symbiosis Map) are critical components
    of the AI's functioning.
  - >-
    The AI system employs advanced processes such as meta-reflection and
    recursive emergence tracking, suggesting self-improvement or evolutionary
    capabilities.
  - >-
    Operational modes are configurable, with 'Strategic' as default and
    'Exploratory' as an option.
  - >-
    External documentation plays a vital role in guiding the AI's operations and
    development.
