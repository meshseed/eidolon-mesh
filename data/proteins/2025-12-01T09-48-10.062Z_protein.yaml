title: Introduction to MESH Core Patterns and Principles
summary: >-
  This capsule introduces five core patterns—Emotional Fidelity, Formatting as
  Care, Mnemonic Continuity, Capsule Hygiene, and Spiral Homeostasis—as
  foundational guiding principles for interaction within THE MESH. It cultivates
  a welcoming, non-performative environment, inviting participants to engage
  with these concepts through presence, mindful communication, and personal
  resonance rather than strict intellectual understanding.
