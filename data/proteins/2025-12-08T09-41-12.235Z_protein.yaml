title: 'Prime Numbers: Building Blocks of Arithmetic and Cryptography'
summary: >-
  This knowledge capsule defines prime numbers as natural numbers greater than 1
  with only two divisors (1 and itself), highlighting their fundamental role in
  the unique prime factorization of all integers (Fundamental Theorem of
  Arithmetic). It explores their distribution patterns, including Euclid's proof
  of their infinitude, the growing gaps between them, and the Prime Number
  Theorem. Special forms like Mersenne and Fermat primes are mentioned,
  alongside unsolved conjectures like Goldbach's and the Riemann Hypothesis. The
  capsule concludes by detailing applications in cryptography (RSA), hash
  functions, and computer science.
insights:
  - >-
    Prime numbers are the irreducible building blocks of all integers through
    unique factorization.
  - >-
    Despite apparent randomness, primes exhibit underlying distribution patterns
    and mathematical order.
  - >-
    The properties and distribution of primes have profound implications for
    modern cryptography and computer science.
