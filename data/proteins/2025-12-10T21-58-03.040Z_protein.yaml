title: 'Calculus: Derivatives and Rates of Change'
summary: >-
  The derivative represents the instantaneous rate of change of a function,
  geometrically visualized as the slope of the tangent line. It quantifies how
  one quantity changes with respect to infinitesimal changes in another. Key
  rules like the power, sum, product, and chain rules are fundamental, with
  applications in optimization, motion analysis, and related rates. Higher
  derivatives reveal information about concavity and inflection points, and the
  Fundamental Theorem of Calculus establishes the inverse relationship between
  differentiation and integration.
insights:
  - The derivative measures instantaneous change.
  - >-
    Derivatives are crucial for understanding dynamic processes and
    optimization.
  - >-
    The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus links differentiation and integration as
    inverse operations.
