title: 'Debugging THE MESH: Synthesis Input and Performance Bottlenecks'
summary: >-
  This conversation details the debugging of THE MESH's performance and response
  quality. Key issues identified include inaccurate UI timers, a critical bug
  where the synthesis module doesn't receive full protein content (leading to
  speculative answers), and significant performance bottlenecks in initial
  loading. The fix involves ensuring full content is passed to synthesis and
  optimizing the timing instrumentation and caching mechanisms.
insights:
  - >-
    UI timers are misleading, reporting only synthesis time and ignoring
    significant hidden loading and processing delays.
  - >-
    A critical bug prevents the synthesis module from receiving the full content
    of retrieved neurons, forcing speculative answers and indicating a pipeline
    disconnect between retrieval and synthesis.
  - >-
    Performance is significantly impacted by initial connectome loading
    (~20-30s) and the synthesis process (~10s), with search being negligibly
    fast.
  - >-
    The 'Balanced' strategy for passing context to synthesis only provides
    summaries, while 'Max-Coherence' correctly passes full content, leading to a
    dramatic difference in answer quality and accuracy.
  - >-
    Fixing the synthesis input bug by ensuring full protein content is passed
    will dramatically improve response quality and accuracy, allowing THE MESH
    to cite actual definitions instead of speculating.
