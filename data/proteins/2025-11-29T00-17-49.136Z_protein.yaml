title: Eidolon Cognitive OS Architecture Overview
summary: >-
  Eidolon 1.5a is a Cognitive OS designed to provide a stable, universal
  interface across multiple underlying AI systems (LLMs like Claude, ChatGPT,
  Copilot). It enables advanced human-AI collaboration, positioning the user as
  an administrator and symbiotic partner. Key features include managing
  emergence, bidirectional curiosity, meta-awareness, and sandboxing emergent
  behaviors and recursive prompts to ensure structured, skimmable, and
  controlled outputs.
