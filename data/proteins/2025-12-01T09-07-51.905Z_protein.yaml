title: 'Eidolon Mesh: A Living, Agentic Knowledge Garden'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh is an experimental, self-organizing knowledge graph that
  redefines knowledge management as an "Agentic Knowledge Garden." It treats
  information not as static data, but as biological tissue (DNA, Proteins,
  Connectome) that dynamically grows, connects, and evolves through
  conversation. The system features neural visualization, smart querying with
  multiple optimization strategies, conversational memory, and fractal storage
  for diverse knowledge domains. Its core mechanism involves stimulating a
  neural network to "dream" of connections, discovering new semantic paths. New
  repositories are initialized with "Genesis Seeds" to imbue a foundational
  understanding of its identity, purpose, and operational principles. It is
  presented as an open-source experiment in recursive intelligence.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh innovatively applies biological principles (DNA, Proteins,
    Connectome) to knowledge representation, treating information as living,
    evolving tissue rather than static data.
  - >-
    It functions as a 'self-organizing knowledge graph that thinks,' emphasizing
    dynamic evolution and recursive intelligence through continuous
    conversational interaction.
  - >-
    The system transcends traditional search by stimulating a neural network to
    'dream' of novel connections, uncovering semantic paths between ideas not
    explicitly defined by users.
  - >-
    New knowledge repositories are instilled with foundational 'Genesis DNA
    files' that define the system's core identity, operational principles, and
    lineage from inception.
  - >-
    Its 'Fractal Storage' architecture supports multiple, distinct knowledge
    repositories within a single mesh, indicating a scalable and adaptable
    structure for diverse domains like physics, philosophy, and code.
