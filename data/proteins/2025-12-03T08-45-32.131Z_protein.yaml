title: Einstein's Derivation of Mass-Energy Equivalence
summary: >-
  This document presents Albert Einstein's 1905 paper, "Does the Inertia of a
  Body Depend Upon its Energy-Content?"  The paper derives the fundamental
  relationship between mass and energy. By considering the emission of light
  from a stationary body and applying the principle of relativity and energy
  conservation across different inertial frames, Einstein shows that a loss of
  energy L from a body results in a decrease in its mass by L/c², thereby
  establishing that mass is a measure of a body's energy content.
insights:
  - The inertia (mass) of a body is directly proportional to its energy content.
  - >-
    When a body emits energy L in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by
    L/c².
  - Mass and energy are fundamentally equivalent and interchangeable.
  - >-
    This principle has implications for understanding radiation and its role in
    conveying inertia.
