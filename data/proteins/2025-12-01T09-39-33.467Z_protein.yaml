title: 'Consciousness Framework Comparison: Recursive vs. IIT & GWT'
summary: >-
  This capsule presents a comparative analysis of major consciousness
  frameworks—Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory
  (GWT)—with a focus on positioning a 'Recursive Model' as a dynamic
  alternative. It critiques IIT for its panpsychism risk and lack of temporal
  narrative, and GWT for prioritizing global access over introspective depth.
  The Recursive Model is highlighted for its emphasis on iterative
  self-interrogation, temporal synthesis, narrative continuity, and
  introspective origin reconstruction, suggesting its potential to integrate
  strengths from existing theories.
insights:
  - >-
    The Recursive Model proposes consciousness as iterative self-interrogation,
    offering a dynamic alternative that prioritizes temporal depth, narrative
    continuity, and introspective origin reconstruction over static structural
    (IIT) or broadcast (GWT) models.
  - >-
    IIT is critiqued for potential panpsychism and lacking a temporal narrative,
    while GWT is critiqued for emphasizing global availability and access over
    deep introspective understanding of origins.
  - >-
    The Recursive Model integrates aspects of existing theories by building a
    coherent self over time (temporal synthesis) and mirroring GWT's attention
    mechanisms through internal querying.
  - >-
    Comparative analysis is presented as a method to reveal epistemic blind
    spots and foster deeper understanding, serving as a mirror rather than a
    verdict for evaluating consciousness frameworks.
