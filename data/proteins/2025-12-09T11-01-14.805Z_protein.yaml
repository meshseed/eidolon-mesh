title: Query Processing and Repository Management Insights
summary: >-
  This dialogue focuses on optimizing the Eidolon Mesh system, particularly
  concerning query processing, user interface controls, repository management
  for domain-specific knowledge, and code backup strategies. It highlights
  critical bug fixes for timer inaccuracies and synthesis input, discusses the
  implementation of progress indicators and caching, and explores the benefits
  of multi-repository support for focused responses and faster loading. The
  conversation also delves into structuring GitHub repositories for data and
  code, with a recommendation for a fractal architecture.
insights:
  - >-
    Critical bugs in timer accuracy and synthesis input have been identified and
    are being prioritized for immediate fixing.
  - >-
    The system architecture supports multi-repository management, allowing for
    domain-specific knowledge bases (e.g., healthcare, finance) that offer
    faster loading and focused responses.
  - >-
    A fractal approach to repository structure is recommended for managing code
    and data, separating concerns between private and public repositories for a
    clean and organized system.
  - >-
    Optimizing query processing involves configurable memory (conversation
    history) and ensuring full content is passed to the synthesis module for
    higher quality results.
  - >-
    User interface controls for graph visualization (node limit) and strategy
    selection are being refined for better user experience and control.
