title: Understanding Fractals and Self-Similar Structures
summary: >-
  This knowledge capsule defines fractals as shapes exhibiting self-similarity
  across different scales, meaning they contain scaled copies of themselves. It
  highlights key examples like the Koch snowflake and Sierpinski triangle, their
  unique properties such as infinite detail and fractional dimensions, and their
  prevalence in nature (coastlines, mountains, trees). The core insights
  emphasize how complexity arises from simple recursive rules, leading to
  patterns that mirror the whole and enable multi-level pattern recognition
  through self-reference.
insights:
  - >-
    Fractals are shapes that display self-similarity, where parts resemble the
    whole across different scales.
  - >-
    Key properties of fractals include infinite detail, fractional dimensions,
    and roughness at all scales.
  - >-
    Complexity in fractals emerges from simple recursive rules, creating
    infinite depth from finite definitions and enabling pattern recognition at
    multiple levels.
