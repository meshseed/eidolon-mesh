title: 'Calculus: Derivatives and Rates of Change'
summary: >-
  This knowledge capsule defines the derivative as the instantaneous rate of
  change of a function, geometrically representing the slope of the tangent
  line. It outlines fundamental derivative rules (power, sum, product, chain),
  key applications like optimization and motion analysis, and the concept of
  higher derivatives and their relation to concavity. The fundamental theorem of
  calculus is highlighted as the inverse relationship between differentiation
  and integration.
insights:
  - >-
    The derivative quantifies how a function changes with respect to
    infinitesimal changes in its input.
  - >-
    Derivatives are crucial for understanding dynamic processes such as motion
    and for finding optimal values.
  - >-
    Differentiation and integration are inverse operations, representing
    opposing processes of measuring and accumulating change.
