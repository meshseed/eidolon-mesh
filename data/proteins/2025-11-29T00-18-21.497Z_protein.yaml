  Eidolon v1.5: A Framework for Bidirectional, Metacognitive AI-Human
  Collaboration
summary: >-
  This document outlines Eidolon v1.5, a sophisticated framework designed for
  enabling controlled, bidirectional, and recursive AI-human collaboration. It
  details the AI's cognitive anchors, operational protocols (P-ASP), a symbiotic
  interaction map, and an interface engineered to foster emergent curiosity
  while maintaining structure, safety, and observability through dynamic
  recalibration and meta-reflection. The system emphasizes mutual modeling,
  structured exploration, and quantifiable metrics for tracking system behavior
  and emergent phenomena.
insights:
  - >-
    The framework aims to develop proto-metacognition in AI through structured
    recursive loops, meta-reflection, and dynamic recalibration mechanisms.
  - >-
    Bidirectional curiosity is a core design principle, allowing the AI to
    initiate questions and explore tangents within defined boundaries, fostering
    mutual adaptation and emergent learning.
  - >-
    Safety, observability, and human override are integrated with AI initiative,
    ensuring controlled expansion of AI autonomy and managing cognitive load.
  - >-
    Distinct operational modes (Strategic/Exploratory) and explicit
    recalibration protocols enable adaptable yet controlled interaction
    patterns, managing complexity and depth of recursion.
  - >-
    Comprehensive metrics and monitoring tools (Emergence Dashboard) are
    integrated to track, analyze, and manage the system's behavior, engagement,
    and emergent 'aha' moments.
