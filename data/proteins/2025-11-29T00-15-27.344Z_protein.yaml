title: Eidolon OS v1-6a File Pre-Staging Protocol
summary: >-
  This dialogue details a strict pre-staging procedure for loading Eidolon OS
  v1-6a files. The user defines a specific instruction set where the system must
  respond with exact, predefined acknowledgment phrases for each file, without
  summarization or deviation, until a 'Begin' command is issued to exit
  pre-staging and resume normal operations.
insights:
  - >-
    A highly controlled, step-by-step file loading and initialization protocol
    is being established.
  - >-
    The process emphasizes strict adherence to predefined responses, ensuring
    minimal and consistent acknowledgments during a sensitive loading phase.
  - >-
    The 'pre-staging' phase is designed to prepare the Eidolon OS v1-6a system
    with core components before full operational mode.
  - >-
    A clear 'Stop condition' ('Begin') is defined to transition the system out
    of its pre-staging state.
