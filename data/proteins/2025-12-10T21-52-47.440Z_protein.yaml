title: 'MeshCODE: A Molecular Gearbox for Synaptic Information Processing'
summary: >-
  This research proposes the 'MeshCODE' theory, suggesting that the talin and
  vinculin protein meshwork at synapses acts as a mechanical computation and
  memory device. By analyzing the structural dimensions and force-dependent
  binary switching of talin domains, the study reveals how these molecular
  switches can dynamically alter the spatial positioning of enzymes and
  substrates within dendritic spines. This mechanism, likened to a gearbox,
  allows for precise control of synaptic transmission and signaling pathways
  through quantised changes in molecular arrangement, potentially encoding
  biological digital information.
insights:
  - >-
    Talin and vinculin proteins form a 'MeshCODE' at synapses, acting as a
    mechanical computation and memory device.
  - >-
    Talin's force-dependent binary switch domains undergo significant length
    changes (up to 10-fold) when transitioning between 'on' (unfolded) and 'off'
    (folded) states.
  - >-
    These molecular shape changes dynamically alter the spatial proximity of
    enzymes and substrates, thereby controlling enzymatic activity and synaptic
    transmission.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE mechanism is analogous to a car's gearbox, allowing for
    quantised, graduated control of synaptic signaling through mechanical
    repositioning of molecular components.
  - >-
    Post-translational modifications (PTMs) on talin switches can further
    integrate biochemical and mechanical signals, profoundly impacting MeshCODE
    dimensions and cytoskeletal connections.
