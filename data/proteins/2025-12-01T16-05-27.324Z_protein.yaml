title: Programming Fundamentals Curriculum
summary: >-
  This dialogue defines a structured, machine-readable curriculum for
  programming fundamentals, organized into levels from core execution models and
  syntax to advanced concepts like concurrency and systems. It breaks down
  programming into discrete, definable concepts with IDs, domains, levels,
  dependencies, and concise statements.
insights:
  - >-
    Programming knowledge can be formally defined and structured for machine
    processing.
  - >-
    A comprehensive programming curriculum covers foundational concepts, data
    structures, algorithms, paradigms, modularity, and systems-level concerns.
  - >-
    Concepts are organized hierarchically and by domain, with dependencies
    indicating prerequisites.
  - >-
    Each programming concept is characterized by an ID, domain, level, and a
    precise, invariant statement.
