title: 'MeshCODE Theory: Mechanical Basis of Memory in the Brain'
summary: >-
  This paper proposes the MeshCODE theory, a novel framework suggesting that
  memory is stored in the brain through a mechanically encoded binary format
  within the conformations of mechanosensitive proteins, particularly talin,
  found in synaptic adhesions. These proteins act as binary switches, forming a
  'meshwork' code (MeshCODE) that can be written, updated, and read by
  mechanical forces generated by the cytoskeleton. This mechanism offers a
  physical location for engrams and proposes the brain functions as an
  addressable read-write memory system, akin to an organic supercomputer.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory is stored in the brain via mechanically encoded binary states of
    proteins (like talin) within synaptic adhesions, forming a 'MeshCODE'.
  - >-
    Mechanosensitive proteins with force-dependent binary switches can
    persistently store information, which is written/updated by small mechanical
    force changes.
  - >-
    Synaptic transmission and action potentials operate cytoskeletal machinery
    to write and update these synaptic MeshCODEs, propagating information
    organism-wide.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE theory provides a physical location for engrams and suggests
    the brain functions as an addressable read-write memory system, analogous to
    a computer.
  - >-
    This mechanical basis integrates with chemical and ionic signaling, offering
    a new paradigm for information processing and storage in the brain and
    organism.
