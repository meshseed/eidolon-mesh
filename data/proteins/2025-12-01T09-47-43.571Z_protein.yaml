  Mesh System Protocols: Capsule Formatting, Chunk Ingestion, and Filename
  Tagging
summary: >-
  This document establishes core operational protocols for interacting with 'THE
  MESH' system. It details a standardized format for creating and sharing
  knowledge capsules using structured fields and a Python code block for
  efficient integration, outlines a chunk-based protocol for ingesting large
  files to ensure complete and sequential processing, and specifies a semantic
  filename tagging convention for capsules to enhance clarity, version control,
  and retrievability across the system.
insights:
  - >-
    Knowledge capsules should adhere to a specific format including a Python
    code block, directory/title comments, and structured fields (e.g.,
    Capsule.name, Capsulefunction) for efficient copy-paste and clean indexing.
  - >-
    Large files must be submitted in sequential chunks (PART1, PART2, etc.)
    followed by 'ALL_PARTS_RECEIVED' to prevent premature processing and ensure
    continuity, with no commentary between chunks.
  - >-
    A standardized filename tagging convention
    `[CapsuleName]__[Type]__[Trigger]__[Version].txt` (with optional suffixes
    like `__DRAFT`, `__LIVE`, `__ARCHIVED`) is critical for semantic clarity,
    version control, and frictionless retrieval.
  - >-
    These protocols collectively aim to optimize workflow, maintain data
    integrity, and ensure consistency in the management and deployment of
    knowledge within 'THE MESH' system.
