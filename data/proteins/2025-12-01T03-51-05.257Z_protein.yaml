title: 'The Mechanical Basis of Memory: The MeshCODE Theory'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE theory proposes that memory in the brain is stored in a
  mechanically encoded binary format within the conformational states of
  mechanosensitive proteins, such as talin, located in cell-extracellular matrix
  (ECM) adhesions at each synapse. These proteins contain force-dependent binary
  switches (folded '0', unfolded '1') that can persistently store information,
  which is written and updated by small changes in mechanical force exerted by
  the cytoskeleton, driven by synaptic transmission and action potentials. This
  framework suggests the brain operates as an 'organic supercomputer' with an
  addressable read-write memory system, where these protein meshworks form a
  code (MeshCODE) that physically represents engrams and coordinates information
  processing throughout the organism. The theory provides a unified mechanism
  for dynamic and persistent data storage, explaining various synaptic
  regulation processes like tagging and competition.

    Memory is proposed to be mechanically encoded in the binary conformational
    states (folded '0' / unfolded '1') of mechanosensitive proteins, primarily
    talin, within the cell-ECM adhesions of synapses, forming a 'MeshCODE'.
  - >-
    Talin, with its 13 conserved force-dependent switches exhibiting mechanical
    hysteresis, is identified as the 'memory molecule of animals', capable of
    persistent, rewritable data storage controlled by cytoskeletal forces.
  - >-
    The brain is conceptualized as an 'organic supercomputer' where
    electrochemical signaling coordinates trillions of mechanical binary
    switches across synapses, providing a physical location for engrams and a
    mechanism for addressable read-write memory.

    The MeshCODE framework offers a unifying theory for data storage in animals
    and provides a mechanical basis for understanding various synaptic
    plasticity phenomena, including dynamic regulation of neurotransmitter
    release, synaptic tagging, inverse synaptic tagging, and synaptic
    competition.
  - >-
    The precise regulation of the mechanical environment within each synapse,
    potentially through ECM maintenance, is crucial for the meticulous
    mechanical computation and information storage envisioned by the MeshCODE
    theory.
