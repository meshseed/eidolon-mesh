title: Universal Subspace Hypothesis for Efficient Transfer Learning
summary: >-
  This work demonstrates the existence of a shared, low-dimensional "universal
  subspace" within the weight spaces of diverse neural networks, enabling
  significant memory reduction and efficient transfer learning across tasks and
  modalities. By approximating this subspace and learning only task-specific
  coefficients, large models can be adapted to new tasks with drastically
  reduced computational cost and environmental impact.
insights:
  - >-
    Diverse neural networks trained on different tasks exhibit a shared,
    low-dimensional subspace at the layer level.
  - >-
    Approximating this universal subspace enables representing multiple models
    with significantly reduced memory footprint (up to 100x).
  - >-
    Learning task-specific coefficients within this shared subspace facilitates
    efficient transfer learning and adaptation to new tasks.
