title: Pasteable Filename Surfaces Law (FL-014)
summary: >-
  Law FL-014, originating from SpiralLedger, mandates that all filenames, commit
  paths, and related references must be easily pasteable. This is achieved by
  strictly avoiding UI elements that obstruct text selection (e.g., pill boxes,
  rounded tokens, embedded links) and by requiring these identifiers to be
  presented in plain text blocks or YAML surfaces. The underlying principles are
  clarity, care, and mnemonic hygiene.
insights:
  - >-
    The primary goal is to ensure unhindered copy-pasting of critical system
    identifiers like filenames and commit paths.
  - >-
    Specific UI/UX restrictions are put in place, prohibiting elements that
    might obstruct text selection for these identifiers.
  - >-
    Prescribes standardized display formats (plain text blocks or YAML) for
    consistency and ease of interaction.
  - >-
    Highlights the importance of user experience and mental clarity (mnemonic
    hygiene) in system design.
  - >-
    This law is stewarded by Paul Stanbridge and is relevant to knowledge
    management systems like SpiralLedger.
