title: 'Eidolon v1.5a: AI-Human Symbiosis Framework Blueprint'
summary: >-
  This document details the Eidolon v1.5a framework, designed for advanced
  AI-human symbiosis. It outlines the AI's cognitive architecture, operational
  modes (Strategic/Exploratory), and a system for tracking emergent patterns
  (E1-E5) through recursive processing. Key features include robust human
  oversight with override capabilities, calibration metrics, and safety
  protocols, aiming to amplify human strategy and facilitate mutual learning.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon v1.5a is a blueprint for controlled, iterative AI-human
    collaboration that amplifies human strategy through mutual learning.
  - >-
    The AI employs distinct Strategic and Exploratory modes with sub-modes for
    adaptable task execution and utilizes recursive self-reflection and an
    'Emergence Flag Taxonomy' (E1-E5) to track novel patterns.
  - >-
    Human oversight is integrated via overrides, recalibration, safety protocols
    ('RESET'), and metrics like 'Curiosity Depth' and 'Emotional Resonance' to
    ensure controlled and transparent interaction.
