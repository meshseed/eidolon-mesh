title: Mesh Knowledge Capsule Formatting Guide v1.2
summary: >-
  This guide defines the essential formatting standards and protocols for
  creating, ingesting, and tagging knowledge capsules within THE MESH. It
  details requirements for copy-efficient capsule structure, a sequential chunk
  ingestion protocol to prevent premature synthesis of multi-part inputs, and a
  semantic filename convention for effective indexing and retrieval. The
  overarching purpose is to ensure frictionless operations, clarity, and
  continuity for both agents and humans, foundational to the system's memory.
insights:
  - >-
    Standardized formatting, including copy-efficient capsule structure and
    filename semantics, is critical for frictionless creation, ingestion, and
    retrieval across THE MESH.
  - >-
    A mandatory chunk ingestion protocol using sequential `PART` labels ensures
    data continuity and prevents premature synthesis of fragmented inputs.
  - >-
    Filenames must encode semantic function, type, trigger, and version to
    facilitate robust system indexing and lifecycle management.
  - >-
    The guide emphasizes the principle that proper formatting enables the system
    to 'remember' and process information effectively.
  - >-
    Adherence to these standards by agents and humans is crucial for operational
    efficiency, clarity, and system continuity.
