title: Connecting Local Gemma 2B to THE MESH
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the process of connecting a locally hosted Gemma 2B
  model to THE MESH, enabling a fully sovereign AI research platform. It
  involves setting up a Flask server with API endpoints for text generation and
  embedding, configuring THE MESH to use the local server, and testing the
  connection.
insights:
  - >-
    THE MESH can be configured to use a local LLM instead of a cloud-based
    service like Gemini by modifying the `.env` file and setting `LLM_PROVIDER`
    to `local` and `LOCAL_LLM_URL` to the Flask server address.
  - >-
    The Flask server needs to expose `/api/generate` and `/api/embed` endpoints
    for text generation and embeddings, respectively, and handle CORS to allow
    cross-origin requests from THE MESH running on a different machine or
    environment.
  - >-
    A single Flask server can serve both the web UI and the API endpoints,
    simplifying the startup process and reducing the number of terminal windows
    required.
