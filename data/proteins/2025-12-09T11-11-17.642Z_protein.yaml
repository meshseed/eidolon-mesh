title: Eidolon Mesh Development and Deployment Status
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the progress of the Eidolon Mesh project, including the
  completion of Phase 17 (Public Portal), the refinement of Phase 14 (Two-Tier
  Architecture for performance optimization), and clarification of runtime
  requirements. The project is confirmed to be runnable with standard Node.js
  tools, independent of the Antigravity development environment.
insights:
  - >-
    Phase 17, focused on making the Eidolon Mesh public, is complete, with new
    documentation (README.md, COMMUNITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md) and a 'Garden'
    metaphor established.
  - >-
    Phase 14, the Two-Tier Architecture, has a refined plan to improve startup
    times by loading core neurons first and using 'ghost nodes' for
    visualization, which the user has approved.
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh application does not require the 'Antigravity' development
    environment to run; standard Node.js commands (npm install, npm run
    dashboard) are sufficient for users.
  - >-
    The project is now ready to be pushed to a public GitHub repository, marking
    a significant step towards public accessibility.
