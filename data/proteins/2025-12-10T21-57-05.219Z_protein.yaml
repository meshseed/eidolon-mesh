title: Pythagorean Theorem in Geometry
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²) describes the fundamental relationship
  between the sides of a right triangle in Euclidean geometry. It has broad
  applications in distance calculations, surveying, and spatial reasoning, and
  is a foundational concept connecting algebra and geometry.
insights:
  - Establishes the core relationship between sides in a right triangle.
  - Serves as a building block for coordinate geometry and distance formulas.
  - Connects algebraic and geometric principles.
  - Applicable only to Euclidean geometry and right angles.
