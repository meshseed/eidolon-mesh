title: Eidolon OS v1.6a Agent Deployment Guide
summary: >-
  This document details the sequential deployment process for Eidolon OS v1.6a
  on AI agents, covering mandatory and optional components for mesh-aware
  cognition, orchestration, and evolution. Key aspects include foundational
  setup with Mesh Seed and Core Protocol, optional specialization via Seed
  Prompts and Agent Adapters, and iterative learning through the Convergence
  Pass.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon OS deployment is a modular, step-by-step process allowing for
