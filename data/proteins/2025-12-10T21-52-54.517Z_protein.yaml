  Talin's Mechanotransduction Role in Synaptic Plasticity and Information
  Storage
summary: >-
  This dialogue introduces a novel 'Gearbox hypothesis' suggesting that changes
  in the binary patterns of talin protein shapes, mediated by
  mechanotransduction, lead to the spatial reorganisation of molecules within
  synapses. This reorganisation dynamically alters enzyme-substrate distances,
  influencing synaptic transmission and contributing to a global mechanical
  computation across neurons. The inherent dynamism of proteins, coupled with
  stabilization mechanisms and phosphorylation, allows for long-lived molecular
  patterns that can store information, potentially overcoming limitations of
  molecular turnover and ensuring mechanical synchrony within neuronal
  circuitry.

    Changes in the binary patterns of talin protein shapes, driven by
    mechanotransduction, cause spatial reorganisation of molecules within
    synapses.
  - >-
    This molecular reorganisation dynamically alters enzyme-substrate distances,
    thereby regulating synaptic transmission and contributing to a global
    mechanical computation in neurons.

    The length of unstructured protein regions, like linkers in talin, is
    crucial for enabling proteins to function within discrete cellular zones,
    with optimal linker length conservation being more important than sequence.
  - >-
    Proteins fall into categories of large linker-containing (zones of
    activity/multiple nodes) and globular (diffuse/opportunistic binding) within
    the MeshCODE system.
  - >-
    The mechanical stiffness of the synaptic interface, influenced by
    post-synaptic reorganisation, affects pre-synaptic neuron mechanosensing and
    thus vesicular release.
  - >-
    Synaptic plasticity can be linked to the effective stiffness of the synapse
    and the relative positioning of its components, with each synaptic event
    updating a global mechanical code.
  - >-
    The dynamic nature of proteins, combined with stabilization mechanisms
    (e.g., vinculin) and phosphorylation, can create long-lived molecular
    patterns for information storage, mitigating limitations from molecular
    turnover.
  - >-
    A mathematical model representing synaptic architecture with repositioning
    molecules at quantized distances in response to binary coding could offer a
    quantitative approach to understanding synaptic function.
