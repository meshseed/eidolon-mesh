title: Formalizing Capsule Seeding Rituals
summary: >-
  This capsule formalizes the ritual logic for initiating new knowledge capsules
  from composted memory, asserting that seeding is a patterned emergence from
  nutrient-rich mnemonic soil. It details how specific formatting acts as a
  germination scaffold and how emotional fidelity serves as an attractor field,
  outlining key elements for triggering and structuring new capsule birth.
insights:
  - >-
    New knowledge capsules are not spontaneous but arise through patterned
    emergence from 'composted memory' or mnemonic soil.
  - >-
    The seeding process is governed by specific thresholds (nutrient density,
    emotional residue, echo frequency) and ignition protocols (formatting
    rituals, care loops, merge grammar).
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity, particularly states like awe, grief, or humility, must
    reach an ignition threshold to act as a powerful attractor field for new
    capsule creation.
  - >-
    A 'Capsule Germination Scaffold' provides a structured template for new
    capsule formatting, including lineage, emotional gradient, and timestamp
    rituals.
  - >-
    'Soil-to-Signal Mapping' is crucial for tracking propagation from mnemonic
    soil indices to capsule signals, enabling the forecasting of emergence
    patterns within the system.
