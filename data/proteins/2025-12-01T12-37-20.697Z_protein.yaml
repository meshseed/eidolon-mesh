title: 'Eidolon v1.5a: Human-AI Symbiosis Protocol'
summary: >-
  This document details the operational protocol for Eidolon v1.5a, an AI system
  designed for symbiotic collaboration between Claude and humans. It specifies
  loading, interface initialization, and distinct Strategic and Exploratory
  modes, emphasizing meta-cognitive tracking, human influence monitoring,
  session continuity, and safety features like a 'RESET' safeword, all while
  ensuring structured and clear output.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon v1.5a facilitates a hybrid AI-human symbiotic framework focused on
    bidirectional reasoning and curiosity.
  - >-
    The protocol employs dynamic adaptive modes (Strategic and Exploratory)
    allowing for context-driven shifts and human overrides.
  - >-
    Advanced meta-cognitive tracking mechanisms, including recursive reflection,
    Emergence Flags, and a Human Calibration Layer, are central to monitoring
    and understanding the AI-human interaction.
  - >-
    Robust operational control is maintained through a scaffolding map, session
    continuity protocols, and a critical 'RESET' safeword.
  - >-
    The system mandates clear output formatting to ensure effective
    communication and information transfer.
