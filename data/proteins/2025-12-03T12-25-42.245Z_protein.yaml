title: Understanding Query and Synthesis Mechanisms
summary: >-
  This dialogue details critical bug fixes and enhancements related to the
  Eidolon Mesh's query and synthesis processes. Key issues addressed include
  timer inaccuracies, synthesis input errors (receiving summaries instead of
  full content), and missing time breakdown for user feedback. Enhancements
  focus on improving user experience through progress indicators, optimizing
  loading strategies (percentage-based, two-tier loading), and implementing
  connectome caching. The conversation also touches upon repository management,
  fractal architecture principles for organizing knowledge and code, and the
  configuration of conversation memory for performance.
insights:
  - >-
    Timer inaccuracies and synthesis input bugs were critical issues impacting
    user experience and output quality, requiring immediate fixes.
  - >-
    Improving loading strategies and implementing progress indicators are key to
    enhancing user perception of speed and transparency during long operations.
  - >-
    Repository management, including multi-repo support and clear distinction
    between workspaces and GitHub repos, is crucial for organizing diverse
    knowledge and code.
  - >-
    A fractal, self-similar architecture is being adopted for organizing code
    and data, reflecting natural systems and promoting wholeness at all scales.
  - >-
    Conversation memory is currently a small, rolling buffer with negligible
    performance impact, and can be safely expanded and made configurable.
