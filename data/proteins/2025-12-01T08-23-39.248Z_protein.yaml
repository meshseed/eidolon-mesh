  Eidolon Mesh v1.1 Stable, Phase 14 Performance Plan, and Phase 17 Public
  Release
summary: >-
  This dialogue captures significant progress on the Eidolon Mesh project,
  encompassing the release of a stable v1.1 build, detailed planning for Phase
  14 (Two-Tier Architecture and Ghost Nodes) to optimize performance for large
  knowledge graphs, and the successful completion of Phase 17 (Public Portal).
  Phase 17 involved extensive documentation updates using a 'Garden' metaphor to
  prepare the project for public GitHub release and community contributions.
  Crucially, the system clarified that the project runs independently with
  standard Node.js tools, without requiring the 'Antigravity' development
  environment.
