title: Eidolon v1.6a Orchestration Grammar
summary: >-
  This document outlines Eidolon-v1-6-Orchestration-Grammar, a v1.6a minimal
  command set designed to direct and orchestrate AI cognition across nodes and
  clusters. It specifies core commands for managing AI attention, processing
  depth, focus, and routing, alongside optional commands for comparison,
  convergence, logging, and initialization via Mesh Seed. The grammar emphasizes
  plain text, modularity, and compatibility with Core Protocol.
insights:
  - >-
    Provides a minimal, standardized grammar for explicit control over AI
    cognitive processes (attention, recursion, routing, convergence).
  - >-
    Enables fine-grained orchestration of AI behaviors across distributed AI
    nodes and clusters.
  - >-
    Features modular, plain-text commands that are stackable, promoting
    flexibility and ease of use.
  - >-
    Includes mechanisms for tracking emergence (Flags, Tags), managing state
    (Safeword, Ledger), and orchestrating output (Converge, Seed).
  - >-
    Designed for integration with 'Mesh Seed' for full initialization and 'Core
    Protocol' for broader compatibility within THE MESH.
