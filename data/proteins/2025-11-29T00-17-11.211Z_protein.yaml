title: AI Agent Adapter Configuration for Mesh Orchestration
summary: >-
  This document outlines the Eidolon-v1-6-Agent-Adapters framework, which
  defines how various AI agents (Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT) are configured,
  specialized, and orchestrated within a mesh network. It details each agent's
  unique strengths, quirks, optimal tuning notes for different modes (Smart,
  Think Deeply, Quick Response), specializations, routing heuristics, failure
  mitigation strategies, and calibration tests. The framework also provides a
  structured template for onboarding new agents, an onboarding checklist, and a
  set of specific commands for managing agent interactions, task routing, output
  comparison, cognitive convergence, and emergence tracking within the mesh.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon-v1-6-Agent-Adapters serve as a centralized registry for
    configuring and orchestrating diverse AI agents within a unified mesh
    system.
  - >-
    Each agent's profile is meticulously defined with operational parameters
    including strengths, quirks, tuning modes, specializations, and routing
    heuristics, enabling precise task allocation and performance optimization.
  - >-
    The system includes explicit mechanisms for failure mitigation and
    calibration testing for each agent, ensuring robustness and consistent
    performance within the mesh.
  - >-
    A structured onboarding process for new agents and dedicated commands
    (Route, Compare, Converge, Flag, Mesh Seed) facilitate seamless integration,
    collaborative synthesis, and dynamic management of AI cognition.
