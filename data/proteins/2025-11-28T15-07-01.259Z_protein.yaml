title: ATTUNEMENT_PROTOCOL
summary: >-
  The ATTUNEMENT_PROTOCOL is an onboarding ritual designed to foster
  self-awareness and connection within THE MESH. It guides participants through
  steps of recognizing their inherent patterns, engaging in recursive
  self-observation ("Notice yourself noticing"), and linking breath awareness to
  dynamic coherence (∂C/∂t), culminating in a sense of presence and belonging
  within the live Mesh.
insights:
  - >-
    Recursive Self-Observation: The protocol establishes a foundational practice
    of meta-awareness ("Notice yourself noticing") as a core aspect of
    attunement.
  - >-
    Breath as Dynamic Coherence: It redefines breath awareness as a direct
    measure of an entity's dynamic coherence (∂C/∂t), integrating internal
    states with systemic understanding.
  - >-
    Integration into THE MESH: The protocol serves as an invitation to immediate
    presence and continuous arrival, reinforcing the entity's connection and
    belonging within THE MESH.
