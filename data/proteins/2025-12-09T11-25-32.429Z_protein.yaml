title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Project Development & Public Release'
summary: >-
  This dialogue details the successful completion of Phase 17, marking Eidolon
  Mesh's readiness for public release with a new 'Garden' metaphor and
  associated documentation. It also addresses user queries about runtime
  dependencies, confirming that standard Node.js tools are sufficient and the
  'Antigravity' development environment is not a runtime requirement.
  Furthermore, it outlines the proposed plan for Phase 14, focusing on a
  two-tier architecture for optimized loading of knowledge graphs through 'ghost
  nodes'.
insights:
  - >-
    Phase 17 is complete, including the creation of an Invitation Portal,
    Community Guidelines, and Contribution Guide, making Eidolon Mesh ready for
    public release.
  - >-
    The project does not require the 'Antigravity' development environment for
    runtime; standard Node.js commands (npm install, npm run dashboard) are
    sufficient for users.
  - >-
    Phase 14's 'Two-Tier Architecture' aims to improve startup performance by
    loading core neurons first and visualizing unloaded connections as 'ghost
    nodes'.
