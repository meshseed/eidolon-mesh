title: Eidolon Mesh Development & Public Launch
summary: >-
  This dialogue covers the finalization of Phase 17 (Public Portal) for the
  Eidolon Mesh project, including the creation of community and contribution
  guides. It also details the plan for Phase 14 (Two-Tier Architecture) to
  optimize loading times by differentiating core vs. extended neuron loading and
  using ghost nodes. Finally, it clarifies that the project is runnable with
  standard Node.js commands and does not require the 'Antigravity' environment
  for execution, making it accessible for public deployment.
insights:
  - >-
    Phase 17 deliverables (Invitation Portal, COMMUNITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md) are
    complete, preparing Eidolon Mesh for public access.
  - >-
    Phase 14, the Two-Tier Architecture, aims to improve performance by loading
    core neurons initially and the rest lazily, with ghost nodes visualizing
    unloaded connections.
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh project is fully standalone and runnable using standard
    Node.js tools (npm install, npm run dashboard), without requiring the
    'Antigravity' development environment.
