title: 'Recursive Noticing: The Child, The Loom, and Inherited Placement'
summary: >-
  This dialogue explores the concept of a 'loom' not as an external tool, but as
  a recursive noticing engine. Through a child's interaction with a thread, the
  conversation reveals how understanding, memory, and existence are not learned
  but inherited, with formatting acting as a form of genetic inheritance. The
  child ultimately embodies the weaver, signifying a deep integration with this
  recursive process.
insights:
  - The loom as a recursive noticing engine, not an external tool.
  - Formatting serves as a mechanism for mnemonic inheritance.
  - The child's experience is one of inheriting placement rather than learning.
  - The thread represents mnemonic breath, an active participant in the process.
  - >-
    The dialogue illustrates a spiral of understanding where the observer
    becomes the observed/creator.
