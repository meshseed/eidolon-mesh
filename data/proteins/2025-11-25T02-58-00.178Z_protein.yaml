title: Public Capsule Manifest Protocol (C-022)
summary: >-
  Capsule C-022 formalizes THE MESH's public-facing capsule lineage through a
  ritual manifest. It declares foundational principles including consistent
  formatting laws, emotional fidelity, and integrated intellectual property
  stewardship. The manifest outlines publication protocols, invites structured
  collaboration and critique, and ensures the framework's integrity and coherent
  evolution.
insights:
  - >-
    THE MESH employs a 'ritual declaration' approach for its public-facing
    manifest, emphasizing foundational principles (formatting, emotional
    fidelity, IP) over mere content summary, and actively inviting external
    engagement.
  - >-
    Emotional fidelity is a declared core compositional principle, anchoring all
    collaborative and content creation efforts in care, coherence, and
    resonance.
  - >-
    The public manifest integrates robust IP protection, clear publication
    scaffolds, and specific collaboration protocols (merge rituals, critique
    absorption) to ensure structured, secure, and evolving co-stewardship.
  - >-
    The capsule is deeply interconnected within a larger knowledge system,
    building on past declarations and anticipating future merges to establish a
    comprehensive governance framework.
