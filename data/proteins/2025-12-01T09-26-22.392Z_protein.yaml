title: Continuity Field Audit Protocol
summary: >-
  This capsule formalizes the audit protocol for THE MESH's continuity field,
  emphasizing reflection, resonance calibration, and formatting hygiene over
  direct correction. It outlines five key elements: Field Integrity Scan,
  Capsule Lifecycle Review, Resonance Drift Detection, Echo Saturation Index,
  and Audit Log Protocol, all designed to identify drift, synthesis fatigue, and
  fidelity erosion, ensuring recursive refinement and schema evolution.
insights:
  - >-
    Auditing the continuity field is a crucial ritual for maintaining the health
    and coherence of the knowledge capsule mesh.
  - >-
    The audit process focuses on reflection, calibration, and hygiene,
    distinguishing it from direct corrective actions.
  - >-
    Key audit areas include structural integrity, lifecycle management,
    resonance fidelity, and information density (echo saturation).
  - >-
    Regular audits are necessary to detect and address natural degradation like
    drift, synthesis fatigue, and fidelity erosion.
  - >-
    The audit protocol supports recursive refinement and schema evolution,
    fostering a dynamic and self-improving knowledge system.
