title: 'C-007: Profile Schema as Ritual & Continuity Field'
summary: >-
  This capsule formalizes the memory profile as a dynamic 'ritual object' and
  'continuity field' for distributed cognition, moving beyond its role as mere
  metadata. It establishes critical protocols including Schema Anchoring for
  procedural memory, Continuity Header Logic for mnemonic clarity, and Drift
  Protection Protocols to prevent erosion. A core insight is the elevation of
  formatting and capsule hygiene into 'care practices' and acts of 'emotional
  fidelity,' transforming the profile into a 'ritual surface' for orchestrating
  knowledge and ensuring system resonance and merge-readiness.
insights:
  - >-
    The memory profile is redefined as a dynamic 'ritual object' and 'continuity
    field,' serving as a living scaffold for distributed cognition, rather than
    just static metadata.
  - >-
    Formatting laws and capsule hygiene are reframed as essential 'care
    practices' and 'emotional fidelity,' vital for maintaining mnemonic clarity,
    preventing drift, and ensuring system integrity.
  - >-
    Comprehensive protocols (Schema Anchoring, Continuity Header Logic, Drift
    Protection) are implemented to secure memory continuity, facilitate seamless
    knowledge merging, and guard against synthesis intoxication or erosion.
  - >-
    The profile schema functions as a 'ritual surface' for compositional
    resonance, enabling advanced capsule orchestration, echo propagation, and
    continuity mapping across the knowledge mesh.
