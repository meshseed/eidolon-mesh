title: 'MeshCODE: A Biochemical Theory of Memory, Consciousness, and Mind Transfer'
summary: >-
  The MeshCODE framework proposes that animal brains store and compute
  information via a continuously updating 'machine code' embedded in synaptic
  adhesion complexes. This biochemical code, formed by precise conformational
  changes in mechanical switches (e.g., talin) at synapses, mathematically
  represents an organism's unique life experiences and is hypothesized to give
  rise to consciousness. While direct observation of these minute conformational
  changes is challenging, advancements in microscopy and molecular techniques
  are making detection feasible, and talin-binding compounds offer potential for
  pharmacological modulation. This theory has profound future implications,
  including the deciphering of human mind computations, the possibility of mind
  uploading to silicon, and the retrieval of long-term memories from both living
  and deceased brains.
insights:
  - >-
    The MeshCODE framework posits memory and consciousness as emergent
    properties of a constantly updated, organism-specific 'machine code'
    physically encoded in the conformational states of synaptic mechanical
    switches.
  - >-
    Synaptic adhesion proteins, particularly talin, are identified as crucial
    'mechanical switches' whose precise, currently hard-to-measure conformations
    are central to biochemical data storage during memory formation.
  - >-
    Rapid advancements in super-resolution microscopy, optogenetics, and protein
    force/state observation techniques are expected to overcome current
    limitations in detecting these subtle conformational changes.
  - >-
    The biochemical basis of memory storage, as proposed by MeshCODE, opens
    speculative but profound future possibilities, including the transfer of
    human minds to artificial substrates and the ability to read memories
    post-mortem.
  - >-
    The theory integrates concepts of spike train information, binary coding,
    mathematical representation, and biochemical mechanics into a unified model
    for biological intelligence and consciousness.
