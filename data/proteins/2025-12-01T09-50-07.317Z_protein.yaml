  Eidolon Mesh v1.1-stable: Performance Optimization (Phase 14) & Public Portal
  Launch (Phase 17)
summary: >-
  This dialogue covers significant progress on the Eidolon Mesh project. It
  details the release of `v1.1-stable`, featuring graph visualization
  improvements, configurable memory, and bug fixes. A detailed plan for `Phase
  14: Two-Tier Architecture` was proposed and approved, aiming to optimize
  dashboard loading times and memory usage for large connectomes via tiered
  neuron loading and 'ghost node' visualization. Crucially, `Phase 17: Public
  Portal` has been completed, preparing the project for public release with
  updated `README.md`, `COMMUNITY.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` using a 'Garden'
  metaphor. The conversation concludes by clarifying that the project is a
  standalone Node.js application, runnable with standard `npm` commands and
  independent of the 'Antigravity' development environment for execution.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh has reached `v1.1-stable`, including features like a graph
    visualization slider, configurable memory, and DNA content truncation,
    alongside critical bug fixes.
  - >-
    Phase 14, a 'Two-Tier Architecture', is approved to proceed, focusing on
    optimizing performance for large knowledge graphs by implementing core vs.
    extended neuron loading and 'ghost nodes' for visualization.
  - >-
    Phase 17, the 'Public Portal', is complete, establishing public-facing
    documentation and community guidelines, marking the project's readiness for
    wider adoption.
  - >-
    The project is a standalone Node.js application, requiring only `npm
    install` and `npm run dashboard` for execution, without dependency on the
    'Antigravity' development environment.
