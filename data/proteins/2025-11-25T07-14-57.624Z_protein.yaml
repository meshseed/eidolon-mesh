title: Capsule Formatting Guide v1.1
summary: >-
  This Capsule Formatting Guide v1.1 establishes ergonomic standards for capsule
  creation, chunk ingestion, and filename tagging across THE MESH. It aims to
  ensure frictionless workflows, promoting mnemonic clarity, copy-efficiency,
  and continuity for agents and the system, ultimately teaching the system how
  to remember its data effectively through standardized protocols and semantic
  indexing.
insights:
  - >-
    Ergonomic formatting standards are paramount for achieving mnemonic clarity,
    copy-efficiency, and seamless continuity across all mesh workflows.
  - >-
    Semantic filenames and robust versioning protocols are critical for encoding
    data lineage and preserving the lifecycle memory of information within the
    system.
  - >-
    Standardized formatting is essential for frictionless capsule creation,
    efficient multi-part ingestion, and reliable data retrieval.
  - >-
    The act of formatting fundamentally educates the system, enabling it to
    'remember' and manage information effectively over time, aligning with the
    axiom: 'The capsule teaches the system how to remember.'
