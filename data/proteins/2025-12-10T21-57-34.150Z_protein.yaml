title: 'Fractals: Infinite Complexity from Simple Rules'
summary: >-
  Fractals are geometric shapes exhibiting self-similarity across different
  scales, meaning they appear similar when magnified. Key properties include
  infinite detail, fractional dimensions, and roughness at all scales.  This
  intricate complexity arises from simple recursive rules, leading to parts
  mirroring the whole and enabling pattern recognition at multiple levels.
insights:
  - Complexity emerges from simple recursive rules.
  - Parts mirror the whole across scales.
  - Pattern recognition at multiple levels simultaneously.
  - Self-reference creates infinite depth from finite definition.
