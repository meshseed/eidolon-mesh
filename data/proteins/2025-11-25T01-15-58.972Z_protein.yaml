title: Mnemonic Soil Index (MSI)
summary: >-
  The Mnemonic Soil Index (MSI) is a ritual metric designed to track the
  generative potential of 'composted' knowledge capsules within a memory
  ecology. Instead of being archived, composted capsules become nutrient-rich
  substrate, allowing the system to view memory decay as a source of future
  resonance and emergence rather than entropy. MSI evaluates capsules based on
  emotional residue, formatting rhythm, nutrient density, and seeding potential.

  - >-
    The Mnemonic Soil Index redefines 'memory decay' as a generative process,
    transforming 'composted' information into a valuable resource for future
    knowledge emergence.
  - >-
    Composted capsules are not deleted or archived but integrated as
    'nutrient-rich substrate' into the memory ecology, fostering new connections
    and insights.
  - >-
    MSI utilizes specific metrics (Emotional Residue, Formatting Rhythm,
    Nutrient Density, Seeding Potential) to quantify the regenerative value of
    decaying information.
  - >-
    The concept emphasizes a cyclical view of knowledge, where past insights
    feed future growth, preventing information loss and promoting continuous
    system fertility.
