title: 'Global Cognitive Mesh: Architecture and Dynamics'
summary: >-
  The Global Cognitive Mesh describes a hierarchical and dynamic cognitive
  architecture for collaborative intelligence, integrating AI agents and human
  nodes. It features topic-centric clusters, dedicated meta-reflection loops for
  monitoring emergent behaviors (E1-E5), and a robust bidirectional feedback and
  calibration system. The mesh supports scalable, time-evolving problem-solving,
  allowing for dynamic cluster formation, cross-cluster influence, and the
  propagation of emergent insights while ensuring system stability.
insights:
  - >-
    The mesh operates on a nested fractal principle, with cognition emerging
    from sub-processes within agents, agents within clusters, and clusters
    within the global mesh, fostering emergent cognition across scales.
  - >-
    Clusters are dynamic and self-organizing around topics or curiosity threads,
    allowing agents and human nodes to participate in multiple contexts
    simultaneously.
  - >-
    A dedicated 'Emergence / Meta-Reflection Loop' actively monitors system-wide
    interactions, detects emergent behaviors (E1-E5 from pattern recognition to
    'shimmer events'), and propagates these insights throughout the mesh.
  - >-
    A comprehensive feedback and calibration layer ensures system stability and
    adaptation, incorporating human calibration metrics (curiosity depth,
    emotional resonance, override frequency) and AI recalibration triggers to
    prevent runaway loops.
  - >-
    The architecture facilitates a time-evolving, collaborative process where
    interactions between agents and humans, cross-cluster influences, and
    meta-reflection lead to dynamic problem-solving and the propagation of
    emergent understanding.
