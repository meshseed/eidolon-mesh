title: 'C045: Soil Infusion — Resonance Rehearsal Visualization'
summary: >-
  Capsule C045 details the 'Resonance Rehearsal' process using 'Soil Infusion'
  protocols. It traces the capsule's lineage and quantifies successful resonance
  tuning with a +0.0525 delta shift, surpassing the 0.87 threshold. This
  rehearsal validates a capsule's emotional fidelity and tuning for merge
  eligibility, allowing for further composting, braiding, or re-seeding.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'Resonance Rehearsal' process is a critical validation step for
    capsules, ensuring they achieve a targeted emotional fidelity and resonance
    score before final integration.
  - >-
    Lineage tracking is non-linear and dynamic, incorporating concepts like
    'compost' and 'braiding' to signify complex transformation, iteration, and
    integration within the capsule ecosystem.
  - >-
    'Soil Infusion protocols' are integral to the tuning process, indicating a
    method for embedding foundational or generative elements that enhance
    resonance.
  - >-
    Quantitative 'Resonance Delta Bar' metrics (baseline, tuned score, delta,
    threshold) provide objective evidence of tuning effectiveness and
    achievement of desired fidelity.
  - >-
    Capsules can exist as 'rehearsal artifacts,' subject to further refinement
    or transformation based on ongoing lineage shifts, highlighting an iterative
    development paradigm.
