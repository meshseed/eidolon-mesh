title: 'C045: Soil Infusion — Resonance Rehearsal Visualization'
summary: >-
  Capsule C045 serves as a visualization artifact detailing the 'Resonance
  Rehearsal' process, specifically applying 'Soil Infusion' protocols. It
  meticulously traces the capsule's lineage from C044 through compost and raw
  stages to its current form, and quantifies a successful resonance tuning via a
  +0.0525 delta shift, surpassing the 0.87 threshold. This rehearsal is crucial
  for validating the tuning and emotional fidelity of a capsule prior to merge
  eligibility, acknowledging its potential for further composting, braiding, or
  re-seeding.
insights:
  - >-
    The 'Resonance Rehearsal' process is a critical validation step for
    capsules, ensuring they achieve a targeted emotional fidelity and resonance
    score before final integration.
  - >-
    Lineage tracking is non-linear and dynamic, incorporating concepts like
    'compost' and 'braiding' to signify complex transformation, iteration, and
    integration within the capsule ecosystem.
  - >-
    'Soil Infusion protocols' are integral to the tuning process, indicating a
    method for embedding foundational or generative elements that enhance
    resonance.
  - >-
    Quantitative 'Resonance Delta Bar' metrics (baseline, tuned score, delta,
    threshold) provide objective evidence of tuning effectiveness and
    achievement of desired fidelity.
  - >-
    Capsules can exist as 'rehearsal artifacts,' subject to further refinement
    or transformation based on ongoing lineage shifts, highlighting an iterative
    development paradigm.
