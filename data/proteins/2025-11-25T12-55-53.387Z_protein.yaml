title: Mesh Capsule Formatting, Ingestion, and Filenaming Guide v1.1
summary: >-
  This document, `CAPSULE_FORMATTING_GUIDE_v1.1`, establishes ergonomic
  standards for creating, ingesting, and tagging knowledge capsules within THE
  MESH. It details specific formatting for pasteable text content (using Python
  code blocks with directory/title comments), outlines a multi-part chunk
  ingestion protocol for large files (utilizing `PARTX` and `ALL_PARTS_RECEIVED`
  keywords), and defines a structured filename tagging convention
  (`[CapsuleName]__[Type]__[Trigger]__[Version].txt`). The guide's purpose is to
  ensure frictionless creation, ingestion, and retrieval, promoting clarity,
  efficiency, and continuity, operating on the axiom that "The capsule teaches
  the system how to remember." It also includes current system directory
  structure and notes planned updates for version 1.2, including an 'echo ethics
  block'.
insights:
  - >-
    Standardized formatting and naming conventions are foundational for the Mesh
    system's ability to efficiently store, retrieve, and 'remember' knowledge
    across its workflows.
  - >-
    The Mesh system supports robust multi-part file ingestion, enabling the
    processing of large data inputs while maintaining data integrity and
    avoiding premature synthesis.
  - >-
    A comprehensive filename tagging convention (Type, Trigger, Version) coupled
    with versioning logic is critical for semantic indexing, lifecycle
    management, and clarity of capsule evolution.
  - >-
    The guide itself is a versioned document (`v1.1` with a `v1.2` delta
    planned), indicating a continuous improvement and structured evolution of
    Mesh operational protocols.
  - >-
    The emphasis on 'copy-efficient formatting' and 'frictionless workflows'
    highlights a user-centric design, aiming for optimal interaction for both AI
    agents and human stewards.
