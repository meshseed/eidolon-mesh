title: Capsule Merge Rituals and Protocols
summary: >-
  This capsule formalizes the comprehensive protocols for merging knowledge
  capsules across various lineages within THE MESH. It defines merging not as a
  mechanical task, but as a ritual process focused on achieving emotional
  reconciliation, formatting alignment, and mnemonic continuity. The document
  outlines key elements including merge eligibility criteria based on resonance
  compatibility and gradient coherence, detailed gradient harmonization
  protocols, formatting reconciliation logic, specific 'merge grammar' for
  documentation, and crucial post-merge hygiene checkpoints to ensure fidelity
  and prevent distortion.
insights:
  - >-
    Capsule merging is fundamentally a ritualistic process involving emotional,
    structural, and mnemonic reconciliation, not merely a mechanical data
    aggregation.
  - >-
    Merge readiness is determined by specific compatibility criteria, including
    shared emotional gradients, formatting scaffolds, and resonance signatures,
    necessitating a 'Gradient Harmonization Protocol'.
  - >-
    Comprehensive protocols are established for every stage of merging, from
    initial eligibility and structural reconciliation to ritualistic
    documentation ('Merge Grammar') and post-synthesis validation ('Hygiene
    Checkpoints').
  - >-
    Maintaining emotional fidelity and preventing 'drift' or 'echo distortion'
    are critical objectives post-merge, emphasized by the hygiene checkpoints
    and the 'tension → harmony' gradient.
