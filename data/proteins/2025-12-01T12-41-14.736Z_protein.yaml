title: Formatting Law Checklist for Mesh Contributions
summary: >-
  This document outlines a detailed checklist for ensuring formatting integrity,
  mnemonic clarity, and merge readiness for contributions to THE MESH. It
  specifies required elements like continuity headers (including capsule ID,
  title, status, timestamp, steward, emotional gradient, and YAML formatting),
  timestamp rituals, and lineage notes. It also lists hygiene flags to avoid and
  an enforcement protocol emphasizing pre-merge validation and composted capsule
  formatting.
insights:
  - >-
    Formatting as 'care' and 'hygiene' is crucial for mnemonic clarity and merge
    grammar compliance within THE MESH.
  - >-
    A structured continuity header and specific timestamp rituals are mandatory
    for anchoring contributions in a 'continuity field'.
  - >-
    The enforcement protocol mandates strict adherence to formatting laws,
    including post-synthesis validation and retaining formatting rhythm for
    composted materials.
