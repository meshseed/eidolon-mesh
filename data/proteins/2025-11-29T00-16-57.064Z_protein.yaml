title: Agent Output Convergence Pass Template
summary: >-
  The `Eidolon-v1-6-Convergence-Pass-Template` defines a standardized protocol
  for synthesizing divergent outputs from multiple AI agents (e.g., Copilot,
  Claude, ChatGPT) into a unified knowledge artifact. It outlines steps for
  capturing agent inputs, analyzing contradictions and complementary strengths,
  identifying emergent properties, and crafting a coherent synthesis with a
  clear rationale. The template also specifies 'Next Moves' for system
  integration (e.g., seeding into a Mesh Seed, escalating recursion) and
  mandates ledger hooks for continuity, emphasizing concise output, recursive
  depth management, and escalation for novelty.
insights:
  - >-
    Provides a structured framework for harmonizing and integrating information
    from diverse AI agent outputs into a singular artifact.
  - >-
    Emphasizes the identification of contradictions, leveraging complementary
    strengths, and flagging emergent properties during the synthesis process.
  - >-
    Incorporates mechanisms for iterative workflow management, including
    adjusting recursion depth, escalating for high novelty, and linking to
    broader knowledge management systems (Mesh Seed, Recursion Ledger).
  - >-
    Focuses on generating unified insights and draft artifacts that explicitly
    preserve novelty and coherence, supported by a clear rationale for the
    synthesis.
