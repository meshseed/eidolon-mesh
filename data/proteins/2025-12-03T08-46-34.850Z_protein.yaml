title: 'MeshCODE Theory: A Mechanical Basis for Memory Storage in the Brain'
summary: >-
  This dialogue introduces the MeshCODE theory, proposing that memory is stored
  in the brain as a mechanically encoded binary format within the conformations
  of mechanosensitive proteins (like talin) found in cell-extracellular matrix
  adhesions at synapses. These proteins act as force-dependent switches, forming
  a 'mesh' that encodes information. Signaling complexes assemble based on these
  switch patterns, dynamically tuning synaptic activity. Synaptic transmission
  and action potentials update this code, essentially creating a physical,
  addressable read-write memory system akin to an organic supercomputer.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory is proposed to be stored in a mechanically encoded binary format
    within proteins at synaptic adhesions.
  - >-
    Talin is identified as a key memory molecule, containing multiple
    force-dependent binary switches.
  - >-
    The MeshCODE theory suggests a physical location for engrams, with
    information encoded in protein conformations and associated signaling
    complexes.
  - >-
    This mechanism provides an addressable read-write memory system in the
    brain, enabling dynamic and persistent information storage.
