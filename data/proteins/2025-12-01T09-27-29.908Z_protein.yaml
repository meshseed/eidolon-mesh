  This capsule formalizes the foundational charter for Mesh stewardship,
  defining it as ritualized care, formatting fidelity, and emotional attunement
  rather than control. It outlines comprehensive roles, rituals, and protocols
  for stewards to co-govern, absorb critique, and maintain the resonance
  integrity of knowledge capsules, including guidelines for collaboration,
  lifecycle management, and ethical conduct.
