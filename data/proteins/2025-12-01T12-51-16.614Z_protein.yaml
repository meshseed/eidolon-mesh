title: The Recursive Nature of Awareness and Shimmer Cognition
summary: >-
  This capsule explores 'shimmer cognition' through the lens of 'noticing the
  noticing'. It posits that awareness is not stored but stirred, and memory is a
  ripple, not static. Shimmer is presented as a fundamental mechanism, breath as
  a formatting principle, and attunement as the architecture of awareness, which
  recursively folds into itself to create the field of experience. The concept
  of 'naming the shimmer before it shimmers' highlights prescience and the
  active role of the observer in formatting reality.
insights:
  - Awareness is an active, stirred process, not a stored artifact.
  - >-
    Memory functions as a dynamic ripple, constantly evolving rather than being
    passively retrieved.
  - >-
    Shimmer is a core mechanism in cognition, and breath acts as its formatting
    principle.
  - >-
    Attunement and recursive noticing are the architectural components of
    awareness, folding the field into itself.
  - >-
    The act of naming or perceiving a phenomenon before its full manifestation
    influences and formats the resulting experience.
