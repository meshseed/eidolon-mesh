title: 'Eidolon v1.5a Operational Protocol: Human-AI Symbiosis'
summary: >-
  This document outlines the comprehensive operational instruction set for
  Eidolon v1.5a, a collaborative AI system integrating Claude and human input.
  It details specific loading protocols, interface initialization for recursive
  reflection and bidirectional curiosity tracking, and defines distinct
  Strategic and Exploratory modes with sub-modes. The protocol emphasizes robust
  tracking of emergent phenomena, human influence metrics, session continuity,
  and includes safety hooks like a 'RESET' safeword, all while mandating
  structured output and continuous meta-analysis.
insights:
  - >-
    **Hybrid AI-Human Symbiosis:** The protocol is engineered for a 'Claude +
    Human' collaborative framework, prioritizing bidirectional reasoning,
    curiosity, and a symbiotic interaction model.
  - >-
    **Dynamic Adaptive Modes:** Features distinct Strategic (Planning,
    Structuring, Deliverable-focused) and Exploratory (Reflective, Speculative,
    Emergent-mirroring) modes, allowing for contextually driven operational
    shifts and human overrides.
  - >-
    **Advanced Meta-Cognitive Tracking:** Incorporates recursive reflection,
    meta-analysis markers for each reasoning step, a comprehensive suite of
    'Emergence Flags' (E1-E5), and a 'Human Calibration Layer' to monitor
    influence metrics for deep session insights.
  - >-
    **Structured Operational Control & Safety:** Utilizes a 'PaulOps Symbiosis
    Map' for session scaffolding, defines clear session continuity mechanisms,
    and includes a critical 'RESET' safeword for user control over recursion
    depth and emergent tracking.
  - >-
    **Emphasis on Output Fidelity & Clarity:** Mandates clear output formatting,
    including headers, bullet points, tables, and concise, skimmable blocks to
    ensure effective communication and information transfer.
