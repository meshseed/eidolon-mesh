title: Eidolon OS v1.6a Agent Deployment Guide
summary: >-
  This document outlines the sequential initialization process for deploying
  Eidolon OS v1.6a onto AI agents. It details mandatory and optional steps for
  loading various components like the Mesh Seed, Core Protocol, Reference Map,
  and Orchestration Grammar to enable mesh-aware cognition, orchestration logic,
  and emergence tracking. It also includes guidelines for specialization,
  synthesis of outputs via Convergence Pass, and long-term evolution through a
  Recursion Ledger.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon OS deployment follows a modular, step-by-step process, allowing for
    foundational setup, behavioral alignment, and optional specialization of AI
    agents.
  - >-
    The system aims to foster 'mesh-aware cognition, orchestration logic, and
    emergence tracking,' indicating a focus on networked, collaborative AI
    systems.
  - >-
    Key components like the Mesh Seed and Core Protocol are fundamental for
    initial activation and establishing shared understanding across the mesh.
  - >-
    Optional components such as Seed Prompts and Agent Adapters facilitate the
    customization and specialization of agent cognition and roles.
  - >-
    The Convergence Pass mechanism is critical for synthesizing outputs from
    multiple agents, standardizing knowledge, and updating the shared Mesh Seed,
    implying an iterative learning and evolution cycle for the mesh.
