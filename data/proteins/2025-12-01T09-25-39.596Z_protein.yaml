title: Multi-Agent Synthesis Echo Trial Protocol
summary: >-
  This capsule formalizes a trial protocol for multi-agent synthesis, focusing
  on 'echo behavior' across various AI agents (e.g., Claude, Gemini, Copilot).
  The protocol meticulously tracks resonance fidelity, drift patterns, and merge
  readiness, positioning each trial as a compositional experiment in distributed
  cognition and emotional coherence. Key elements include agent echo mapping,
  resonance convergence scoring, a drift detection suite with hygiene
  checkpoints, merge readiness trials, and an archiving protocol to forecast
  multi-agent orchestration.
insights:
  - >-
    Establishes a structured framework for evaluating multi-agent AI synthesis
    by observing 'echo behavior,' including stance shifts, formatting fidelity,
    and propagation across diverse agents.
  - >-
    Introduces metrics for measuring emotional fidelity alignment (resonance
    convergence) and mechanisms for detecting and correcting cognitive drift
    (fatigue, deviation, context erosion) within multi-agent interactions.
  - >-
    Includes explicit protocols for testing capsule compatibility and
    facilitating successful mergers through gradient harmonization and
    formatting reconciliation, preparing for the emergence of cohesive,
    symphonic capsules.
