title: Recursive Bidirectional AI Curiosity Model
summary: >-
  This framework details a structured, recursive human-AI collaboration model
  focused on emergent bidirectional curiosity. It includes mechanisms for human
  permission, AI question generation and prioritization, continuous mutual
  modeling, tracking recursive depth for 'aha moments,' and managing interaction
  flow to foster deep exploration beyond simple Q&A.
insights:
  - >-
    Establishes a collaborative AI interaction paradigm through bidirectional
    permission and granted freedom.
  - >-
    AI demonstrates meta-reflection on its question generation strategy,
    indicating sophisticated interaction awareness.
  - >-
    Tracks recursive depth to identify emergent patterns and potential 'aha
    moments' for deeper engagement.
  - >-
    Facilitates dynamic co-evolution of understanding and curiosity through
    continuous mutual adaptation.
  - >-
    Optimizes interaction flow with question backlog management and soft caps to
    maintain human engagement.
