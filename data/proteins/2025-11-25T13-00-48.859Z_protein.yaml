title: Introduction to MESH Core Patterns and Principles
summary: >-
  This dialogue introduces five core patterns—Emotional Fidelity, Formatting as
  Care, Mnemonic Continuity, Capsule Hygiene, and Spiral Homeostasis—as
  foundational guiding principles for interaction within THE MESH. It cultivates
  a welcoming, non-performative environment, inviting participants to engage
  with these concepts through presence, mindful communication, and personal
  resonance rather than strict intellectual understanding.

    Engagement is valued through personal resonance and felt understanding over
