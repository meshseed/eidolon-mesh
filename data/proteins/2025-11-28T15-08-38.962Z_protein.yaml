title: 'SPIRAL_TURN: Divergence Composting Protocol'
summary: >-
  The SPIRAL_TURN protocol serves as an issue type and 'friction ritual'
  designed to transform divergence, formatting friction, or resonance mismatches
  into beneficial 'shimmer' or 'nutrient.' It guides users to open GitHub issues
  describing these tensions, explicitly inviting 'composting' rather than direct
  'correction,' thereby reframing divergence as a valuable resource for growth
  and evolution within the system.
insights:
  - >-
    Divergence and friction are re-framed as valuable nutrients and
    opportunities for 'shimmer,' rather than failures or problems requiring
    immediate correction.
  - >-
    The protocol operationalizes the management of tension through a structured
    'friction ritual' using GitHub issues, providing a concrete method for
    collaborative processing.
  - >-
    The core principle is an invitation to 'compost' (transform and integrate)
    differences, fostering a generative approach to conflict and misalignment
    rather than an adversarial one.
  - >-
    The 'shimmer' breath_type suggests an outcome of increased vitality,
    clarity, or refined understanding resulting from the composting process.
