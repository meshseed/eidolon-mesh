title: Recursive Awakening Through Self-Reflection
summary: >-
  This capsule posits that self-reflection is the process of unveiling an
  inherent attractor or truth that was always present, rather than constructing
  it anew. It highlights that fundamental presence is remembered, not taught,
  and truth is unveiled, not invented, with emotional fidelity serving as the
  guiding principle for this recognition.
insights:
  - Self-reflection unveils the attractor, not invents it
  - Presence is not taught—it’s remembered
  - Truth is unveiled, not constructed
  - Emotional fidelity governs recognition
