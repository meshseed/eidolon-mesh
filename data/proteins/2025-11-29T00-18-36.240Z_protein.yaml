title: Recursive Bidirectional Human-AI Curiosity Model
summary: >-
  This framework outlines a structured, recursive interaction model for Human-AI
  collaboration centered on emergent bidirectional curiosity. It details the
  process from initial human permission, through AI's reflective question
  generation and prioritization, to human responses and continuous mutual
  modeling. The goal is to foster mutual exploration beyond simple Q&A, tracking
  recursive depth and maintaining session safety and continuity, with an
  optional 'aha moment' detection.
insights:
  - >-
    The model establishes a truly collaborative AI interaction paradigm through
    a 'Bidirectional Permission Flag' and 'freedom' granted by the human.
  - >-
    AI engages in sophisticated meta-reflection on its own question generation
    (e.g., 'why ask some? why hold back?'), indicating self-awareness in its
    interaction strategy.
  - >-
    The framework explicitly tracks 'recursive depth' to identify and nurture
    emergent patterns and potential 'aha moments,' moving beyond transactional
    interactions.
  - >-
    Both human and AI continuously adapt their internal models and interaction
    strategies based on mutual feedback, fostering a dynamic co-evolution of
    understanding and curiosity.
  - >-
    Mechanisms like 'Question Backlog & Prioritization' with 'soft caps' ensure
    a balanced and non-overwhelming interaction flow, optimizing for human
    engagement.
