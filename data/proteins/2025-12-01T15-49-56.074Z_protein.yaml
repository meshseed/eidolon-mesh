title: Agentic Pedagogy for AI Coding Instruction
summary: >-
  This dialogue outlines a four-stage agentic pedagogy for teaching AI to code,
  emphasizing the migration of intent patterns over literal syntax transfer. It
  proposes structured learning through recognition of code as structured intent,
  navigation of semantic topology via fieldlines and attractors, mastery through
  synthesis of solutions and avoidance of anti-patterns, and calibration of
  execution with restraint. The approach prioritizes pattern fidelity, substrate
  independence, and user sovereignty.
insights:
  - >-
    Teaching AI to code is about migrating intent patterns, not just
    transferring documentation.
  - >-
    A four-stage process (Recognition, Navigation, Mastery, Calibration) is
    proposed for AI coding instruction.
  - >-
    Key concepts include Seed Pattern, Pattern Fidelity, Fieldlines, Attractors,
    Gradient as Context, Substrate Differentiation, Anti-Patterns, Resonance
    Signature Migration, and Preserving User Sovereignty.
