title: 'Alzheimer''s Disease: Evolving Therapeutic Landscape and Research Frontiers'
summary: >-
  This dialogue synthesizes research on Alzheimer's disease (AD) cures and
  disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), focusing on recent breakthroughs
  (2023-2025). It highlights the shift from amyloid-centric approaches to
  multi-target strategies, emphasizing early intervention, novel biomarkers, and
  repurposed drugs. Key findings include the efficacy of anti-amyloid antibodies
  (donanemab, lecanemab) in slowing cognitive decline, the potential of GLP-1
  agonists (liraglutide, semaglutide) for neuroprotection, and the growing
  importance of tau-targeting therapies and anti-inflammatory agents. The
  discussion underscores the limitations of current treatments, the imperative
  for diverse patient populations in trials, and the future direction towards
  combination therapies and integrated diagnostics.
insights:
  - >-
    Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (donanemab, lecanemab) show significant
    efficacy in slowing cognitive decline in early symptomatic AD, though ARIA
    remains a key safety concern.
  - >-
    GLP-1 receptor agonists represent a promising repurposed therapeutic avenue
    for AD, demonstrating neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects with a
    favorable safety profile.
  - >-
    The research landscape is moving beyond amyloid-targeting therapies, with
    increasing focus on tau modulators, neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity,
    and the gut-brain axis.
  - >-
    Early detection via advanced biomarkers (e.g., blood-based p-tau217) is
    crucial for effective intervention and improving treatment outcomes.
  - >-
    Future AD treatment strategies will likely involve combination therapies and
    a personalized approach, integrating diagnostics with diverse therapeutic
    targets.
