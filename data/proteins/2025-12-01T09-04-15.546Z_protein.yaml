title: 'Eidolon Mesh: Digital Organism for Knowledge Synthesis'
summary: >-
  Eidolon Mesh is a digital organism designed to ingest conversations,
  synthesize knowledge into "proteins," and build a semantic connectome for
  intelligent query responses. It features a modular architecture (Membrane,
  Ribosome, Connectome, Query Organelle, Dashboard), command-line utilities for
  ingestion and querying, and a web interface. Key features include conversation
  memory, diverse query optimization strategies, and detailed performance
  metrics. It's a TypeScript project with a stable, working configuration for
  knowledge processing and retrieval.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Mesh is a digital organism that processes conversations into
    structured knowledge ('proteins') and constructs a semantic connectome for
    intelligent query responses.
  - >-
    Its architecture is modular, consisting of distinct components: Membrane
    (I/O), Ribosome (synthesis), Connectome (semantic network), Query Organelle
    (response generation), and Dashboard (visualization).
  - >-
    The system supports command-line interaction for ingesting dialogues and
    querying the knowledge base, complemented by a web dashboard for
    visualization and interaction.
  - >-
    Key features include configurable conversation memory, multiple query
    optimization strategies (e.g., Balanced, Max Coherence, Max Connectivity,
    Diverse Hubs), and performance metrics like query duration and coverage.
  - >-
    Data storage is organized with separate directories for original dialogues
    (DNA), synthesized knowledge proteins, and the semantic network structure
    (`connectome.json`).
  - >-
    The project is developed using TypeScript and has reached a stable state,
    incorporating full content loading, connectome caching, strategy controls,
    performance logging, and conversation memory.
