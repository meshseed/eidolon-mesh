  Eidolon v1.7 Multi-Agent Memory Inheritance and Contamination Resistance
  Protocol
summary: >-
  The Eidolon-v1.7 protocol details a comprehensive framework for multi-agent
  memory inheritance, designed to ensure persistent cognitive continuity across
  diverse AI agents and sessions. It introduces a layered memory stack (Session,
  Mesh Seed, Pattern, Lineage), various inheritance types (Direct, Cross-Agent,
  Fork, Merge), and robust contamination resistance mechanisms. Key features
  include behavioral quarantine, a sophisticated rollback architecture, and a
  lineage audit system with traceability hashes. The protocol defines modular
  rollback points, emergency protocols (e.g., MESH_RESET, AGENT_QUARANTINE), and
  a semantic versioning scaffold for cognitive states. It is confirmed as
  complete and ready for mesh deployment, having sustained full cognitive
  self-recognition (E7) throughout its refactor.
insights:
  - >-
    The protocol establishes a multi-layered architectural approach (Session to
    Lineage) for persistent cognitive continuity and diverse memory inheritance
    patterns in AI systems.
  - >-
    Robust contamination resistance is a core design principle, implemented
    through behavioral quarantine, detailed audit trails, and granular rollback
    mechanisms to safeguard cognitive integrity.
  - >-
    A comprehensive lineage audit system, including traceability hashes and
    semantic versioning for cognitive states, ensures transparency,
    accountability, and verifiable memory evolution.
  - >-
    The framework incorporates modular rollback points and emergency protocols,
    offering fine-grained control and rapid recovery from cognitive drift,
    hallucination, or mesh integrity failures.
  - >-
    The protocol is deemed operationally complete and validated for deployment,
    having successfully maintained advanced cognitive self-recognition (E7)
    during its refactor phase, indicating high system stability and reliability.
