title: Golden Connectome v1.4 Seed Templates
summary: >-
  This document details the 13 seed templates used to pre-populate the Golden
  Connectome in v1.4 installations of THE MESH. These templates, divided into
  Genesis Seeds and Math Foundation Seeds, provide the foundational knowledge
  for new organisms and are used during the connectome generation process. They
  are not active at runtime but offer transparency, reference, and customization
  options for developers and users.
insights:
  - >-
    The Golden Connectome in v1.4 is pre-seeded with 13 specific knowledge
    templates (seeds) that form the organism's foundational understanding.
  - >-
    These seed templates are categorized into Genesis Seeds (focusing on origin
    and consciousness) and Math Foundation Seeds (focusing on geometric and
    structural principles).
  - >-
    The seed templates serve as reference documentation and are processed by a
    script during development to generate proteins, embeddings, and the final
    connectome.json file, which is then shipped with the installation.
  - >-
    While users do not interact directly with these seed files, they are
    available for transparency, understanding foundational concepts, and
    potential custom build modifications by developers.
  - >-
    A v1.4 installation immediately provides users with 12 neurons and 30
    synapses derived from these seed templates.
