title: 'Prime Numbers: Building Blocks and Mysteries'
summary: >-
  Prime numbers are fundamental to arithmetic, being the unique building blocks
  of all integers via prime factorization. While infinitely many exist, their
  distribution exhibits both patterns (like the Prime Number Theorem) and
  significant gaps. Special forms like Mersenne and Fermat primes exist, and
  unsolved conjectures (Goldbach, Riemann Hypothesis) point to ongoing mysteries
  in their distribution. Primes are crucial for applications in cryptography and
  computer science.
insights:
  - Primes are the irreducible building blocks of all integers.
  - >-
    There is underlying order within the seemingly random distribution of
    primes.
  - A simple definition leads to profound complexity and open questions.
  - >-
    Prime factorization is unique for every integer greater than 1 (Fundamental
    Theorem of Arithmetic).
