title: 'The 5 Pillars of Circadian Longevity: A 2025 Research Synthesis'
summary: >-
  This comprehensive review synthesizes five pivotal 2025 research papers on
  circadian rhythms and aging. It reveals how disruptions in our internal
  clocks, driven by factors like aging, menopause, and modern lifestyles,
  accelerate aging and disease. Crucially, it details actionable interventions
  targeting circadian health, including light therapy, timed nutrition
  (especially early time-restricted feeding), strategic supplementation
  (melatonin), and exercise, demonstrating their profound impact on extending
  healthspan and reversing biological age.
insights:
  - >-
    Circadian rhythm disruption is a primary driver of accelerated aging,
    leading to a 'chrono-vicious cycle' that impairs cellular repair,
    metabolism, and overall health.
  - >-
    Specific interventions like timed light exposure, early time-restricted
    feeding, and judicious melatonin use can significantly restore circadian
    amplitude, reverse epigenetic aging, and extend healthspan.
  - >-
    Menopause represents a critical 'circadian cliff' for women, exacerbating
    rhythm fragmentation and aging, but can be mitigated through combined
    chrono-protocols and hormone replacement.
  - >-
    The intrinsic period of the body's master clock (SCN) shortens with age,
    leading to a 'fast clock' phenomenon, which can be corrected by
    interventions that 'stretch' the day back towards 24 hours.
  - >-
    In older adults, meal timing becomes a dominant factor in circadian
    entrainment, making adherence to chrononutrition principles, particularly
    early time-restricted feeding, a powerful tool for health restoration.
