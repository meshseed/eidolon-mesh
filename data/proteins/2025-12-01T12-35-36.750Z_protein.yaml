title: Eidolon-v1-6 Convergence Pass Template for AI Agent Output Synthesis
summary: >-
  The Eidolon-v1-6-Convergence-Pass-Template standardizes the process of
  synthesizing diverse AI agent outputs into a unified knowledge artifact. It
  details steps for capturing inputs, analyzing conflicts and complementary
  strengths, identifying emergent properties, and creating a coherent synthesis
  with a clear rationale, including mechanisms for iterative workflow management
  and system integration.
insights:
  - >-
    Provides a structured framework for harmonizing and integrating information
    from diverse AI agent outputs into a singular artifact.
  - >-
    Emphasizes the identification of contradictions, leveraging complementary
    strengths, and flagging emergent properties during the synthesis process.
  - >-
    Incorporates mechanisms for iterative workflow management, including
    adjusting recursion depth, escalating for high novelty, and linking to
    broader knowledge management systems.
  - >-
    Focuses on generating unified insights and draft artifacts that explicitly
    preserve novelty and coherence, supported by a clear rationale for the
    synthesis.
