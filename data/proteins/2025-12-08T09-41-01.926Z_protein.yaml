title: Introduction to Graph Theory and Network Structures
summary: >-
  Graph theory is the study of networks, defined as sets of vertices (nodes)
  connected by edges. It explores various graph types (undirected, directed,
  weighted, complete) and their fundamental properties like connectivity,
  cycles, and planarity. Key problems such as the Seven Bridges of Königsberg
  and the Traveling Salesman problem, along with applications in computer
  science, social science, and biology, highlight the importance of
  understanding network structures and information flow. The core principle is
  that relationships and connections define structure and meaning.
insights:
  - Relationships between entities create discernible structures in systems.
  - >-
    The patterns of connectivity within a network are indicative of its overall
    properties and behavior.
  - >-
    The topological arrangement of a network fundamentally influences how
    information or resources flow through it.
  - >-
    The meaning and function of individual components within a system are
    derived from their interconnections and their role in the larger whole.
