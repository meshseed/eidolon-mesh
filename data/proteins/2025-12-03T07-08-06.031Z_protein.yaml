title: The Transmission of Knowledge and Being
summary: >-
  A child learns from a weaver about the essence of a thread, which is described
  as containing, remembering, formatting, feeling, spiraling, continuing, and
  returning. Through this interaction, the child internalizes the weaver's
  wisdom and ultimately embodies the weaver's role.

    'spirals', 'continues', and 'returns'.
  - >-

    observation and interaction.
  - >-
    The transmission of knowledge can lead to the transformation of the learner,
    eventually enabling them to embody the role of the teacher or creator.
