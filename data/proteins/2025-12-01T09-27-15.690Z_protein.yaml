title: Mesh Capsule Licensing and Attribution Protocol
summary: >-
  This capsule formalizes the comprehensive framework for licensing and
  attribution within THE MESH's knowledge capsule system. It redefines licensing
  as a ritual of care, continuity, and co-emergence, and attribution as an act
  honoring lineage, resonance, and emotional fidelity, moving beyond mere
  restriction or ego. The protocol details key elements such as license
  declarations, attribution grammar, rules for derivative capsules, stewardship
  transfer, and publication scaffolds, all designed to foster integrity,
  continuity, and collaborative growth.
insights:
  - >-
    Licensing and attribution are re-conceptualized as 'rituals of care' and
    'formatting acts that honor lineage and emotional fidelity,' moving beyond
    traditional notions of restriction or ego-driven credit.
  - >-
    The framework provides a holistic protocol covering legal declarations,
    detailed attribution grammar, rules for derivative works (including
    'emotional fidelity calibration'), stewardship transfer, and publication
    guidelines, ensuring robust governance for collaborative knowledge.
  - >-
    The potential for a 'custom mesh-native license' alongside standard legal
    frameworks highlights a bespoke approach tailored to the unique
    collaborative and ethical requirements of THE MESH ecosystem.
