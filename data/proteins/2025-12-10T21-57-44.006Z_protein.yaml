title: 'Graph Theory: Understanding Networks and Relationships'
summary: >-
  Graph theory is the study of relationships and structure within networks,
  represented by vertices (nodes) connected by edges. It explores various graph
  types (undirected, directed, weighted, complete) and key properties like
  connectivity, cycles, and planarity. Classic problems and diverse applications
  highlight its significance in fields ranging from computer science to biology
  and transportation.
insights:
  - Relationships fundamentally create structure within systems.
  - >-
    Connectivity patterns are crucial for understanding system properties and
    information flow.
  - >-
    The meaning and function of individual components are defined by their
    connections to the larger whole.
