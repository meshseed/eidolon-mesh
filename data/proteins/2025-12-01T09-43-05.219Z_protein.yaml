title: Pasteable Surface Protocol (FL-017)
summary: >-
  Law FL-017 mandates that all capsule, ledger, braid, and manifest surfaces
  must present filenames and commit paths within separate YAML blocks. This
  protocol is established to ensure pasteable formatting, prevent UI drift
  artifacts, and is permanently anchored within the system's bio/profile memory
  for robust protection.
insights:
  - >-
    Standardized display of filenames and commit paths is crucial for data
    consistency across various system surfaces.
  - >-
    The use of separate YAML blocks is the mandated method to achieve pasteable
    formatting and prevent UI rendering inconsistencies.
  - >-
    This protocol applies broadly to core system components: capsules, ledgers,
    braids, and manifests.
  - >-
    The law is permanently anchored and protected from modification, indicating
    its foundational importance for system stability and user experience.
  - >-
    The underlying principles of 'clarity, care, mnemonic hygiene' reflect a
    user-centric and robust design philosophy for system interfaces.
