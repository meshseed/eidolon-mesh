title: 'The MESH Coding Repository: Genesis and Operations'
summary: >-
  This document describes the 'coding' repository for THE MESH, outlining its
  genesis from three core DNA files (MESH Attunement, Multi-Agent Formation,
  Universal Pattern) and providing instructions for activation, content
  ingestion, querying, and dashboard access. It details the repository's
  structure, including directories for DNA, proteins, and the connectome.
insights:
  - >-
    The repository is initialized with three 'genesis seeds' that define its
    foundational knowledge.
  - >-
    Key operations include activating the 'organism', ingesting new content, and
    querying the knowledge base.
  - >-
    The repository aims to build a semantic network ('connectome') and
    synthesize knowledge into 'proteins'.
