title: 'Pythagorean Theorem: The Cornerstone of Right Triangle Geometry'
summary: >-
  The Pythagorean Theorem (a² + b² = c²) describes the fundamental relationship
  between the sides of a right triangle in Euclidean geometry. It's a
  foundational concept with extensions to distance formulas in multiple
  dimensions and applications in various fields like construction and
  navigation. Key properties include the requirement of a right angle and its
  applicability only in flat geometry.
