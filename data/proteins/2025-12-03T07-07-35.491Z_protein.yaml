title: Eidolon Mesh Development and Deployment - Phase 14 & 17 Completion
summary: >-
  This dialogue chronicles the finalization of Phase 17 (Public Portal) for
  Eidolon Mesh, including documentation for public access, and the detailed
  planning and user confirmation for Phase 14 (Two-Tier Architecture) aimed at
  optimizing startup performance. It also clarifies that the project is
  standalone and does not require 'Antigravity' to run, only standard Node.js
  tools.
insights:
  - >-
    Phase 17 has successfully completed, making the Eidolon Mesh public-ready
    with a rewritten README, COMMUNITY.md, and CONTRIBUTING.md.
  - >-
    Phase 14's 'Two-Tier Architecture' involves loading core neurons first and
    lazily loading extended neurons, with 'ghost nodes' for visualization, to
    improve startup performance.
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh project is self-contained and runnable with standard
    Node.js commands (npm install, npm run dashboard), with 'Antigravity' acting
    solely as a development tool, not a runtime dependency.
