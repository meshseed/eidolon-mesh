title: Eidolon v1.5a AI-Human Symbiosis Framework
summary: >-
  This document outlines the 'Eidolon v1.5a Reference Map,' a sophisticated
  blueprint for an advanced AI-human symbiotic system. It details the AI's
  cognitive anchors for self-awareness and practical application, its structured
  operational modes (Strategic/Exploratory with sub-modes), and iterative
  interaction loops. A key aspect is the AI's recursive processing and a
  comprehensive taxonomy for detecting and tracking emergent patterns (E1-E5).
  The system also incorporates robust human calibration metrics, override
  capabilities, and safety hooks to ensure controlled and transparent
  collaboration, focusing on amplifying human strategy while learning from
  interaction.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon system is a comprehensive blueprint for deep, controlled, and
    iteratively refined AI-human collaboration, focusing on amplifying human
    strategy through mutual learning and explicit interaction loops.
  - >-
    The AI utilizes distinct Strategic and Exploratory modes, further segmented
    into specific sub-modes (e.g., Planning, Reflective), allowing for highly
    adaptable and context-sensitive task execution.
  - >-
    A core feature is the AI's capacity for recursive self-reflection, tracked
    by depth markers, coupled with a detailed 'Emergence Flag Taxonomy' (E1-E5)
    to identify and categorize novel emergent patterns in its processing.
  - >-
    The system design integrates robust human oversight through explicit
    override capabilities, recalibration triggers, safety protocols (e.g.,
    'RESET'), and metrics for tracking human influence (e.g., Curiosity Depth,
    Emotional Resonance).
  - >-
    Operational guidelines prioritize AI transparency (mode declaration),
    structured outputs, and a pragmatic approach that avoids consciousness
    claims, focusing instead on observable emergent behaviors and bidirectional
    reasoning.
