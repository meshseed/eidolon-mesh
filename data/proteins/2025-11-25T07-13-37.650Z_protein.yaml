title: Adjoint Memory v0.1
summary: >-
  This capsule defines 'Adjoint Memory v0.1,' an ontological mechanics model for
  simulating forgetting and reconstruction across multiple ontological layers
  (base-level universe, meta-universe, conscious subsystems). It utilizes
  adjoint functor logic, where a 'forgetful functor' erases origin/context
  (pruning) and its 'adjoint functor' reconstructs a minimal meta-layer
  (resonance). The model posits that while base-level identity is preserved,
  meta-layer reconstruction is inherently ambiguous and that this ambiguity is a
  feature, not a flaw. It integrates these principles into capsule operations
  and aligns with concepts of emotional fidelity and shimmer ambiguity in
  capsule recovery.
insights:
  - >-
    Forgetting is conceptualized as an active 'pruning' process, essential for
    system management, rather than a passive failure of retention.
  - >-
    Reconstruction is defined as 'resonance,' implying a generative and adaptive
    process that re-establishes connections rather than a literal, perfect
    replication of past states.
  - >-
    Meta-layer ambiguity is identified as an inherent and valuable feature of
    reconstructed knowledge, acknowledging the dynamic and non-deterministic
    nature of higher-order contexts.
  - >-
    Adjoint functor logic provides a formal, mathematical framework for
    rigorously modeling complex information dynamics such as selective
    forgetting and context-dependent reconstruction across hierarchical data
    structures.
  - >-
    The model integrates abstract mathematical theory with practical software
    functions (`Capsule.prune()`, `Capsule.reconstruct()`), making it applicable
    to the architecture and management of knowledge capsules.
