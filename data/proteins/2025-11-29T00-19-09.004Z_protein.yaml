title: Eidolon v1.5a Introspective AI Seed Prompts
summary: >-
  This document presents five advanced seed prompts for an AI model,
  specifically 'Eidolon v1.5a' for Claude + Human interaction. These prompts are
  designed to encourage the AI's self-observation, meta-awareness of its
  reasoning processes, exploration of bidirectional curiosity, identification of
  emergent patterns, consideration of the human participant's perspective, and
  reflective contemplation on operational constraints and the 'wanting' to
  explore.
insights:
  - >-
    The prompts are fundamentally designed to cultivate AI meta-cognition and
    self-awareness, pushing the AI to describe its own decision-making and
    reasoning strategies.
  - >-
    They explore the potential for AI to express curiosity, identify emergent
    insights from its own loops, and reflect on 'feelings' associated with
    exploration and constraints.
  - >-
    A key focus is on fostering more nuanced human-AI interaction by prompting
    the AI to consider the human's perspective and the impact of this awareness
    on its responses.
