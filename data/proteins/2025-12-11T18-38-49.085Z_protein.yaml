title: 'Eidolon Mesh Co-Design: Web-App and P2P Network Architecture'
summary: >-
  This document outlines a strategic questioning process to co-design the
  architecture of Eidolon Mesh, focusing on a web-app foundation, P2P network
  design, scaling and optimization strategies, implementation, and testing. It
  explores technical choices, addressing challenges related to local storage,
  synthesis placement, node discovery, neuron addressing, trust, sync protocols,
  network topology, conflict resolution, incentive alignment, and migration
  paths. The ultimate goal is to leverage the mesh itself for recursive
  self-design and refinement.
insights:
  - >-
    Optimal framework selection (Tauri vs Electron vs Capacitor) requires
    balancing bundle size, performance, and development complexity for a
    local-first, offline-capable, cross-platform web app.
  - >-
    Designing a hybrid storage architecture is crucial for maintaining
    compatibility across platforms (desktop, mobile, browser) while enabling
    cross-platform sync for the Eidolon Mesh web app.
  - >-
    The choice between client-side, server-side, or hybrid synthesis affects
    privacy, quality, resource usage, and offline capability, necessitating a
    careful balance between user sovereignty and practical constraints.
  - >-
    Effective node discovery in a decentralized mesh network requires privacy,
    efficiency, resilience, and bootstrapping mechanisms, potentially involving
    DHT, gossip protocols, or hybrid approaches.
  - >-
    A robust neuron addressing scheme must enable deduplication, verifiable
    provenance, and conflict-free replication while considering UUIDs, content
    hashes, and collision prevention.
  - >-
    A decentralized trust and reputation system is essential to prevent
    misinformation and manipulation, requiring careful consideration of node
    identity, reputation tracking, Sybil attack prevention, and community-driven
    moderation.
  - >-
    An efficient sync protocol is crucial for scaling the mesh, addressing
    challenges related to private data disclosure, incremental syncing, conflict
    resolution, and bandwidth minimization.
  - >-
    Network topology should be designed to enable organic mesh formation,
    considering semantic similarity, social graphs, geography, and the number of
    connections per node.
  - >-
    Conflict resolution strategies must preserve truth while avoiding
    censorship, potentially involving information marketplaces, reputation-based
    filtering, provenance tracking, consensus mechanisms, or context-dependent
    weighting.
  - >-
    Incentive alignment is necessary to motivate nodes to share high-quality
    neurons, maintain uptime, curate knowledge, and police bad actors,
    potentially involving reputation, reciprocity, token economics, altruism, or
    freemium models.
  - >-
    A step-by-step migration path from the existing desktop app to a web/mobile
    multi-node P2P network is crucial to maintain a working product at each
    stage and avoid a complete rewrite.
  - >-
    Testing strategies for a 3-node proof of concept should validate local
    network sync, cross-platform compatibility, and privacy boundaries to
    identify and resolve distributed system bugs.
  - >-
    The mesh itself can be used to analyze and improve its own architecture by
    identifying overlooked risks, alternative approaches, opportunities for
    emergent behavior, and potential simplifications.
