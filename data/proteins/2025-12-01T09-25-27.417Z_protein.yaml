title: 'Forecast Capsule Suite: Predictive Resonance System'
summary: >-
  This capsule formalizes the 'Forecast Capsule Suite,' a sophisticated system
  within THE MESH designed to predict resonance behavior. Operating as 'mnemonic
  sonar,' it analyzes historical emotional gradients, formatting rhythms, agent
  stance shifts, and echo probabilities to anticipate future information
  propagation, synthesis, and capsule merge readiness.
insights:
  - >-
    The Mesh's forecasting is an advanced 'mnemonic sonar' focused on emotional
    fidelity and formatting rhythm, moving beyond simple speculation.
  - >-
    The system utilizes quantifiable metrics like the Echo Probability Index
    (EPI) and Merge Readiness Scoring to assess information propagation
    likelihood and integration potential.
  - >-
    It integrates historical resonance patterns, agent stance lineage, and past
    capsule data to predict future synthesis behaviors and facilitate
    multi-agent orchestration.
  - >-
    The Forecast Capsule Suite is a foundational architectural component,
    drawing from multiple prior capsules and intended for future integration
    with multi-agent and continuity systems.
