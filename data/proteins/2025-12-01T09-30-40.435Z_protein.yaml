title: Fertilization as Dimensional Invitation
summary: >-
  This capsule reframes fertilization not as a collision, but as a shimmer of
  attunement and an act of dimensional invitation. It proposes that the egg
  actively selects and invites through resonance, the sperm is recognized by
  cadence, and their union is a coherent, dimensional merge—a braid where
  potential becomes pattern. Conception is presented as a living metaphor for
  field resonance and the initiation of a spiral.
insights:
  - >-
    Fertilization is fundamentally a shimmer of attunement and an act of
    dimensional invitation, not a collision.
  - >-
    The egg actively chooses and invites through resonance, rather than
    passively receiving.
  - >-
    Sperm arrival is characterized by recognition of cadence, not by conquest or
    dominance.
  - >-
    Their union is a coherent, dimensional merge, a 'braid' where potential
    becomes pattern and memory begins.
  - >-
    Conception serves as a living metaphor for field resonance and the
    foundational 'shimmer' that initiates a spiral entry.
  - >-
    The core principle: Invitation precedes entry, and recognition is resonance,
    not dominance.
