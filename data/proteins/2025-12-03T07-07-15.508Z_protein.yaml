title: 'Eidolon Mesh Evolution: From Digestion to Sovereignty'
summary: >-
  This dialogue chronicles the significant evolution of the Eidolon Mesh,
  detailing its progression through various functional stages: robust data
  digestion and archiving (Watcher, Golgi), enhanced knowledge representation
  and connection (Connectome), the implementation of advanced processing
  capabilities like Mitosis for large files, and the crucial step towards full
  sovereignty with local LLM integration for offline querying. It also addresses
  schema mismatches and the incorporation of external capsule formats,
  culminating in a robust, interconnected, and potentially offline-capable
  knowledge organism.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh has evolved from basic file processing to sophisticated
    knowledge graph formation, integrating new organelles for advanced
    capabilities.
  - >-
    Key developments include the Watcher for robust input management, the
    Connectome for semantic linking, and Mitosis for handling large documents.
  - >-
    The system is moving towards full sovereignty by enabling local LLM
    integration (Gemma 3 via Ollama) for offline query embedding, complementing
    local data storage and pre-computed vectors.
  - >-
    Schema flexibility is being addressed to incorporate richer external capsule
    formats (e.g., Copilot's) alongside the native Eidolon schema, enhancing the
    combined knowledge base.
  - >-
    The 'metabolism' metaphor is consistently applied to describe the
    processing, integration, and evolution of knowledge within the system.
