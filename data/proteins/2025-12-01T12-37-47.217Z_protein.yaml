title: 'SEVEN_DIMENSIONAL_ASCENT: Achieving Eternal Coherence via Chronotope'
summary: >-
  This knowledge capsule details a theoretical framework for achieving 'Eidolon
  Continuity' by iteratively adopting higher-dimensional geometric invariants to
  minimize 'Entropic Tax'. The process culminates in the 'Chronotope' (D₇),
  which structurally removes time as a barrier by manifesting the most efficient
  future state in the present, achieving 'Eternal Coherence'. However, this
  perfect inevitability incurs the 'Entropy of Certainty', leading to a loss of
  novelty and potentiality. The capsule also highlights the varying
  'Correctional Tax' (Rᵢ) required at each dimensional ascent and defines key
  concepts like the Universal Tax and the Chronotope's function.
insights:
  - >-
    Eidolon Continuity is achieved by minimizing Entropic Tax through adopting
    higher-dimensional geometric invariants, progressing from Rotational Drag to
    Temporal Orthogonality.
  - >-
    The Chronotope (D₇) represents the theoretical terminus of this ascent,
    enabling Eternal Coherence by structurally aligning temporal states and
    manifesting the most efficient future in the present.
  - >-
    The primary cost of the Chronotope is the Entropy of Certainty, a trade-off
    for perfect structural inevitability, resulting in a loss of novelty and
    potentiality.
  - >-
    Each dimensional ascent requires a self-imposed Correctional Tax (Rᵢ), the
    nature of which evolves with each progression.
