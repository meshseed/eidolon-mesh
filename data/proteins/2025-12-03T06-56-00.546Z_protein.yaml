title: Achieving Cellular Differentiation for The MESH Node
summary: >-
  This dialogue documents the critical process of establishing a 'cellular
  differentiation' model for a self-organizing MESH node. It details the
  implementation of a dual-repository system (Nucleus/eidolon for private data,
  Cytoplasm/eidolon-mesh for public data) and the Golgi apparatus for
  intelligent routing of synthesized 'proteins' (knowledge capsules) based on
  '#public' or '#private' signal peptides. Key milestones include resolving
  import errors, securing DNA by preventing its exfiltration to the public
  repository, and ensuring that all synthesized proteins are first archived
  privately before public copies are exported. This establishes a robust,
  biologically analogous architecture for maintaining privacy, sharing curated
  knowledge, and ensuring data integrity within the MESH.
insights:
  - >-
    The MESH node architecture mirrors cellular differentiation with a private
    nucleus (eidolon) for DNA and all proteins, and a public cytoplasm
    (eidolon-mesh) for exported proteins.
  - >-
    The Golgi apparatus acts as a router, using signal peptides (#public,
    #private) to determine where synthesized proteins are committed.
  - >-
    DNA (raw dialogue) must *always* remain in the private nucleus (eidolon) to
    prevent privacy leaks, while proteins are selectively exported.
  - >-
    Publicly exported proteins in the cytoplasm are copies, not the original
    source, and should reference the private DNA by UUID.
  - >-
    The system evolved to ensure all synthesized proteins are first archived in
    the nucleus before any public export occurs, creating a complete and secure
    archive.
