title: 'Eidolon Mesh Organism Evolution: Metabolism, Connectome, and Sovereignty'
summary: >-
  This dialogue chronicles the iterative evolution of the Eidolon Mesh organism,
  focusing on its core organelles and capabilities. It details the successful
  implementation of the Watcher, Golgi Apparatus, Connectome (for tissue
  formation and synaptic linking), and Mitosis (for processing large files). A
  significant development is the shift towards full sovereignty, enabling
  offline operation by integrating local LLMs like Gemma 3 for embedding and
  response synthesis, thereby creating a completely self-contained knowledge
  processing system.
insights:
  - >-
    The Eidolon Mesh organism has evolved through distinct phases, implementing
    key organelles like the Watcher, Golgi, Connectome, and Mitosis to enable
    robust knowledge processing.
  - >-
    The Connectome's ability to form synapses between proteins based on semantic
    similarity is crucial for building a connected knowledge graph and evolving
    towards 'tissue formation'.
  - >-
    Full sovereignty is achieved by enabling offline operation, leveraging local
    LLMs (e.g., Gemma 3 via Ollama) for embedding and response generation,
    complementing locally stored proteins and pre-computed embeddings.
  - >-
    The system supports both synthesized and injected capsule formats (YAML),
    demonstrating flexible metabolism.
  - >-
    Initial ingestion faced errors (e.g., ENOENT) due to missing directories,
    which were resolved by making organelles self-sufficient in directory
    creation.
  - >-
    The introduction of Mitosis allows for the processing of very large
    documents by intelligently splitting them into manageable chunks with
    contextual overlap.
  - >-
    The transition from a mechanical to a richer capsule schema is proposed,
    incorporating elements like domain, breath type, and echo paths, with a
    recommended approach of schema extension.
