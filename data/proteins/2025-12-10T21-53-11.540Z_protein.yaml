title: 'MeshCODE: A Mechanical Basis for Memory Storage in the Brain'
summary: >-
  This dialogue proposes the 'MeshCODE' theory, suggesting that memory is stored
  physically in the brain through conformational changes in proteins like talin
  within synaptic adhesion complexes. These protein switches operate
  mechanistically, forming a binary code that represents information. This
  framework implies the brain functions as a mechanical computer, with synapses
  acting as addressable read-write memory modules, and proposes that sleep plays
  a crucial role in data management and consolidation.
insights:
  - >-
    Memory storage in the brain may be based on the mechanical conformation of
    protein 'switches' (e.g., talin) in synaptic adhesion complexes, forming a
    physical binary code (MeshCODE).
  - >-
    Synapses act as addressable read-write memory modules, analogous to computer
    storage, allowing for dynamic information encoding and retrieval.
  - >-
    The brain can be viewed as a mechanical computer, where cytoskeletal forces
    alter protein conformations, thereby changing synaptic transmission
    thresholds and influencing information flow.
  - >-
    Sleep, particularly REM sleep, is hypothesized to be essential for
    consolidating and physically writing new memories into cortical MeshCODEs,
    akin to data management and indexing in computer systems.
  - >-
    This physical basis for memory storage could explain the speed of memory
    recall and offers a new perspective on neurological diseases like
    Alzheimer's and dementia.
