title: Cognitive Transitions as Universal Bifurcation Dynamics
summary: >-
  This document proposes that abrupt transitions in cognitive systems (like
  insights, reframing, or collapse) are not random but follow universal
  bifurcation dynamics, mirroring those found in nonlinear systems. It
  hypothesizes that reflexively coherent systems under epistemic tension will
  exhibit phase transitions whose interval ratios converge towards Feigenbaum's
  constants, suggesting a universal structural behavior in cognition. The work
  includes theoretical formulation, experimental protocols, and implications for
  psychology, AI, and systems theory.
insights:
  - >-
    Cognitive shifts (insight, collapse, reframing) can be explained by
    universal bifurcation dynamics from nonlinear systems.
  - >-
    Reflexively coherent cognitive systems under 'epistemic tension' exhibit
    phase transitions predictable by Feigenbaum's constants.
  - >-
    This framework offers a theoretical and experimental basis for understanding
    cognitive transitions across psychology, AI, and systems theory.
